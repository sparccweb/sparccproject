SPARCC Team members gather for the October 2019 convening in Chicago.


<h1 dir="ltr">Sweet Home Chicago: Investing in Equitable Transit-Oriented Development to Keep the Windy City Connected to Its Roots</h1>


<h2><em>The &ldquo;Second City&rdquo; has always been a place of change and renewal. Chicago, a city that was devastated by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, has proved its resiliency time and time again by continuing to reinvent itself. </em></h2>
<p><strong>Chicago is home to 77 community areas</strong> including Bronzeville and La Villita (Little Village), Chinatown and Uptown, and Washington Park and Jefferson Park. Each community has its own unique flavor and rhythm, like the blues that flowed up from the South during the Great Migration, to the immigrant sounds of son Cubano and banda from Latin America, but it all blends perfectly into what songwriter Robert Johnson called &ldquo;Sweet Home Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>While Chicago is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse cities in the United States &ndash; it also is one of the most inequitable.</strong> For a while now, Chicago stakeholders have expressed concern about the uneven distribution of risks and resources, lack of investment, and opportunity along racial lines in communities across the region. Local advocates for equitable development described Chicago&rsquo;s predominantly Black neighborhoods on the South Side as experiencing systemic disinvestment and suffering the impacts of school closures, gun violence, and urban flooding. In contrast, the predominantly white, amenity-rich neighborhoods on the North Side of the city don&rsquo;t experience the same levels of disinvestment or impacts. They also noted the roles of &ldquo;anchor institutions&rdquo; (like universities and hospitals), increasing property taxes, and green investments (like The 606 and &ldquo;El Paseo&rdquo; rails-to-trails projects) in furthering investment-driven displacement in Chicago.</p>
<h2><em>It was clear that urgent action was needed to ensure that the Windy City would not be blown away by the winds of growing inequities that are morally wrong, and socially and economically unsustainable.</em></h2>
<p><strong>SPARCC partnered with Elevated Chicago, the Urban Displacement Project, and other local partners to assess local dynamics around gentrification, displacement, and exclusion in Chicago.</strong> The study examined processes of gentrification and displacement in low-income neighborhoods and exclusion in moderate-to-high-income neighborhoods. Neighborhoods were categorized as exclusionary when rents became so expensive that low-income people were excluded from moving in &mdash; another form of displacement. Most neighborhoods south of the Loop (downtown Chicago) were classified as low-income areas, in some cases experiencing displacement and/or displacement risk, while many of the city&rsquo;s most exclusive areas were concentrated in predominantly white areas north of the Loop. These two reports and the lived experience of Chicagoans painted a tale of two cities. Spurred into action, Elevated Chicago began recruiting their steering committee, prioritizing diversity among many attributes, and setting their collaborative culture. Even before the formal initiative launch in 2017, Elevated Chicago was intent on ensuring that their collaborative would be rooted in the community. They identified and presented a community-led solution to neighborhood displacement and inequities using an underutilized asset: the public transit system. Historically, trains have connected people to places. Elevated Chicago believes transit can also connect people to ideas, innovations, and capital, both within and outside of communities.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>What is ETOD?</em></strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.elevatedchicago.org/whats-etod/"><em>Equitable Transit-Oriented Development</em></a><em>, or eTOD, is the tool Elevated Chicago is using to build a global, inclusive city where all residents thrive in neighborhoods whose health and resiliency indicators no longer depend on race.</em></h2>


<p><strong>In 2017, SPARCC awarded Elevated Chicago its first grant and started sharing its Equitable Transit-Oriented Development (eTOD) plans with city officials.</strong> It was meant to be a tool to connect residents with more than just transit and to begin to undo decades of harmful segregation. With 145 train stations and 129 bus routes serving virtually every neighborhood, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) provided an unmatched opportunity to build a different city by leveraging its stops and hubs as assets that can connect communities. Elevated Chicago built coalitions around seven CTA stations&ndash; called eHubs.</p>
<p><strong>But early on it was tough.</strong> In 2017-2018, some City leaders and staff (such as the Dept. of Public Health) were highly committed to ETOD, while others were often a no-show to Elevated meetings. After lots of difficulties getting the City government to coordinate their actions, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel announced an immediate start to the eTOD work as he pondered a reelection bid. While he ended up withdrawing his candidacy, he left a door wide open for Elevated Chicago and the Lori Lightfoot administration.</p>
<p>Roberto Requejo (Elevated Chicago) was tapped to co-chair the mayor&rsquo;s transition committee on transportation, while other Elevated Steering Committee members served in the Health, Housing, and Youth committees &ndash;among others. Mayor Lightfoot and her leadership appointed a number of people in Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s orbit. Appointments included: Marisa Novara (MPC) as housing commissioner, Juan Carlos Linares (LUCHA) as community engagement director, Jennie Fronczac (LUCHA) as executive director of Chicago Community Land Trust, and Juan Sebastian Arias (Enterprise and MPC) to run the eTOD work for the mayor&rsquo;s office. This was a sea-change for Chicago agencies, as leaders from the local community and civic organizations took on newly appointed positions in the city.</p>
<p>Mayor Lightfoot leaned into eTOD as a tool and Elevated Chicago had laid important groundwork for community partnerships, ideas, and sites. In Partnership with Elevated, the City produces its first-ever equitable transit-oriented development plan in September 2020.</p>

<p>Projects across Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s eHubs have been ongoing since before the official adoption of the City&rsquo;s ETOD plan, but the plan has enabled key partnerships and relationships across the city to accelerate the work&ndash; and bring in more funding. Here&rsquo;s a list of the projects that SPARCC invested in:</p>
<h3><strong>Elevated Chicago at Green Line South: Emerald South&rsquo;s Branding Initiative</strong></h3>
<p>Designed to create a cohesive visual identity for the Green Line South area throughout Washington Park and Woodlawn to coordinate development strategies, improve services and attract residents and businesses.</p>
<h3><strong>Elevated Chicago @ Green Line South: Overton Center of Excellence</strong></h3>
<p>The Overton Center for Excellence is an arts, business, and technology hub for the Bronzeville community and beyond. This catalytic project will provide a place for our young adults and budding entrepreneurs for the Bronzeville renaissance we are currently experiencing.</p>
<h3><strong>Elevated Chicago at Logan Square: LUCHA&rsquo;s Here to Stay Land Trust</strong></h3>
<p>The Land Trust is a scalable, multi-pronged strategy that will preserve the stock of naturally occurring affordable housing in the target area by creating a competitive, self‐regenerating acquisition fund, rehabbing multifamily buildings, and cultivating a pipeline for low to middle-income families.</p>
<h3><strong>Elevated Chicago at California Pink Line: Latinos Progresando&rsquo;s Community Resource Center</strong></h3>
<p>The community resource center will serve as a hub for providing access to immigration legal services, behavioral mental health screening, and treatment, trauma-informed group counseling sessions for all ages, and a robust referral system.</p>
<h3><strong>Elevated Chicago at California Pink Line: Esperanza Health Center</strong></h3>
<p>Esperanza is a 20-year-old Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that plays a critical role in the mental and physical health of residents on the West Side, including those with immigration status concerns and LGBTQ+ needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Elevated Chicago at Kedzie Green Line: Garfield Park Community Council&rsquo;s Garfield Green Project</strong></h3>
<p>Garfield Green is a new, 40-80 unit housing development, known as C40; it will be developed by Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH) at Kedzie and Fifth Avenues, along with a City of Chicago-designated &ldquo;Resilient Corridor.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><strong>Elevated Chicago at Kedzie Blue Line: Foundation for Homan Square&rsquo;s Affordable Homes for People With Disabilities</strong></h3>
<p>The construction of 21 units on currently vacant land will provide affordable units accessible for people with disabilities as well as those transitioning out of long-term care facilities.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Combined, these projects have brought close to $10 million dollars into the Chicago neighborhoods that are most in need. These dollars can help bring about sustainable economic growth while keeping the integrity of the city intact.</strong></em></h2>


<p>When Robert Johnson crooned, &ldquo;.<strong>..Come on baby, don&rsquo;t you wanna go; to that same old place</strong>,&rdquo; he wasn&rsquo;t talking about a gentrified playland for the wealthy. He was talking about a city that welcomed <br>people from all walks of life. A place that allowed people to thrive instead of pushing them out to make way for shiny new bobbles. He sang of a familiar place, a place for opportunity, a home. The work of SPARCC, Elevated Chicago, and its local partners will ensure that the beauty and diversity of those 77 distinct communities remain the place that we&rsquo;ve all come to know and love &mdash;<strong>&ldquo;Sweet Home Chicago.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Why Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s Approach is Different</strong></h3>
<p>Elevated Chicago is focused on bringing equitable transit-oriented development (eTOD) to <a href="http://www.elevatedchicago.org/start-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">seven sites</a> across the city where people of color are at risk of being displaced by gentrification or lack of investment. ETOD is a development strategy that focuses on areas around transit stops as places to invest in small businesses, housing, public art, green infrastructure and other assets&mdash;with the hope of retaining residents and improving their quality of life.</p>
<p>With a combined focus on public art, health, climate, and above all, racial equity, projects supported by Elevated Chicago and its partners range from connecting community to a food service incubator near a West Side transit stop to filling funding gaps on a $2.1 million community center in a predominantly Latino neighborhood along the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pink Line,&rdquo; an 11-mile part of the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;L&rdquo; transit system.</p>
<p>To date, Elevated Chicago has aligned philanthropic and governmental sources of funding and deployed more than $1 million in grants to nonprofit organizations supporting the seven target areas and the collaborative&rsquo;s ambitious systems change agenda. But it&rsquo;s not just the money that has caught people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difference is that Elevated is led by people of color,&rdquo; says Program Director Roberto Requejo. And those perspectives, he says, are &ldquo;not the usual perspectives&rdquo; one finds at the tables that make development decisions about the fate of Chicago&rsquo;s neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Instead, this is neighborhood development led by residents working together with city leaders, urban planners, and developers to both induce new development and ensure that it is equitable. The effort is intentional about connecting leaders and experts across fields, including public health, affordable housing, transit, arts and culture, and climate change.</p>
<p>Past attempts to bring capital and development to neighborhoods, Requejo said, were either explicitly racist or overtly colorblind by not paying attention to people of color. The result was disinvestment in certain neighborhoods and displacement in others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re moving from a place that started from institutional racism to one with racial equity at the center,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Most decisions are made by consensus of the assembled group, including representatives from eight community-based organizations (such as Sunshine Enterprises, KLEO Center, LUCHA or Foundation for Homan Square), Chicago Department of Public Health, and leading mission-driven investors and philanthropy organizations like the Chicago Community Trust, Enterprise, <a href="https://iff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">IFF</a>, and private sector representatives from Washington Park Development group and ThoughtWorks. Additionally, Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s Leadership Council periodically engages senior leadership from the Mayor&rsquo;s Office and several city departments, the Chicago Transit Authority and other regional leaders to extend their work to critical institutions.</p>
<p>This rich collaboration, transparency, and impact have led philanthropies to align their funding with Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s goals and city departments to coordinate their work in ways that complement the organization&rsquo;s mission. The Chicago Department of Public Health, for example, targeted its $200,000 pool of grants and technical assistance for walkability projects in the seven hubs where Elevated works, said Requejo.</p>
<p>As a result of the collaborative process, grants have been more representative of community voices. For example, a grant to <a href="http://blackgirlsbreakbread.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Black Girls Break Bread</a> focused on how African American girls experience transit and neighborhood development. The group was not on the radar of any of the funders at the table, said Requejo, but community partners familiar with it pulled its application from the pile.</p>
<p>Elevated&rsquo;s success can also be attributed to another factor: conflict fatigue. People are tired of the standard opaque, top-down approaches to neighborhood investment, and of having to constantly organize <em>against</em>, rather than for, development, Requejo said. Elevated&rsquo;s horizontal model is an alternative to the &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo; culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our table is a flat one, and we find solutions that have appeal to a diversity of partners,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h3><strong>Making a Real Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s work is gaining adherents as its projects take root.</p>
<p>In late 2018,for example, the Mayor&rsquo;s Office approached it to help shape the city&rsquo;s TOD Ordinance renewal. The ordinance, first enacted in 2015, allows developers to increase density and to reduce the number of required parking spots for new housing near transit stops. In the renewal, the City wanted to expand the definition of &ldquo;transit&rdquo; to include several busy bus routes and sought Elevated&rsquo;s input to ensure equity and community support.</p>
<p>While Elevated Chicago was more than happy to help, it also had an ask &ndash; for the City to add an explicit racial equity lens to the ordinance, addressing the risk of resident displacement that can occur with TOD and the depopulation in bypassed neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The result is a rule that <a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2018/12/102101-chicago-ordinance-focuses-equitable-tod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">explicitly calls out equity</a>&mdash;an <em>eTOD ordinance</em>. Developments should avoid &ldquo;displacement of residents, small businesses, cultural institutions, and community organizations&rdquo; and encourage &ldquo;investment in communities of color and low-income communities and appropriately addressing various market conditions,&rdquo; the ordinance states.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for the close and transparent collaboration between our steering committee members and the City departments involved, the provisions for developing an equity policy plan wouldn&rsquo;t have been as rich and thoughtful,&rdquo; Requejo said.</p>

<p>The call for more equitable development wasn&rsquo;t created out of thin air. Logan Square, for example, lost nearly <a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160516/logan-square/logan-squares-hispanic-population-dropped-by-19000-since-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">20,000</a> Latinos between 2000 and 2014 as various TOD projects, including the wildly successful 606 Trail, led to rising <a href="https://www.housingstudies.org/research-publications/publications/measuring-impact-606/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">housing costs</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/wisniewski/ct-biz-affordable-housing-logan-square-getting-around-20181029-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">rapid gentrification</a>. During the same period, the city&rsquo;s Black communities lost 200,000 residents due to a mix of market pressure and disinvestment across different parts of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you let us test how can we make TOD equitable, we will show you that the results will be beneficial to everyone,&rdquo; Requejo <a href="https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/chicago-has-a-plan-to-build-near-cta-trains-but-who-does-it-help/e967316b-2d98-4d1b-b2f3-2ba1eb066929" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">told WBEZ</a>, &ldquo;and in particular will elevate the outcomes in health, in climate resiliency, in access to arts and culture, for residents of those communities, which are majority people of color, and for the entire city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the foot of the &ldquo;L&rdquo; transit station at Kedzie and Lake in Chicago&rsquo;s East Garfield Park neighborhood, residents have watched as a vacant lot has been transformed into <a href="https://thehatcherychicago.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">The Hatchery</a>, a 67,000 square foot building with shared and private kitchens, training spaces, and food storage, all designed to help food service businesses get off the ground. In collaboration with Elevated Chicago partners, the owners have incorporated training opportunities for small business owners and workforce development programs for residents. After the 12-week program, graduates are guaranteed placement in a high-end Chicago restaurant.</p>
<p>Just down the street is the future site of something you don&rsquo;t always see in a city: a fruit orchard. Part of the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://www.metroplanning.org/uploads/cms/documents/michael_berkshire_resilient_corridors.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">resilient corridors</a>&rdquo; program to handle storm water more efficiently, the <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dcd/provdrs/sustain/news/2018/january/financial-proposal-would-support-development-of-community-orchar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">East Garfield Park Community Eco Orchard</a> will help the city prevent flooding while training local residents in tree care and other green skills. The residents will also benefit from the fresh fruits available from the orchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at this orchard [as part of] the food hub in the neighborhood, so it will not only bring food but bring jobs to the neighborhood,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.elevatedchicago.org/people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Mike Tomas</a>, executive director of the Garfield Park Community Council and Elevated Chicago member, <a href="https://www.austinweeklynews.com/News/Articles/3-6-2018/An-orchard-on-the-West-Side%3F-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">told Austin Weekly News</a>.</p>
<p>Farther north in rapidly gentrifying Logan Square, Elevated Chicago partners worked with developers building a boutique hotel on the site of a former furniture factory to create <a href="https://logansquarist.com/2019/01/28/real-estate-developer-commits-to-hiring-local-work-force-for-new-hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">a community benefits agreement</a>. Usually hard to pull off and often controversial, a community benefits agreement is a project-specific, negotiated agreement between a developer and a community coalition that outlines the project&rsquo;s contributions to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But in this case, Elevated Chicago partners created the right table. Two leading community organizations, the Center for Changing Lives and Logan Square Neighborhood Association, met with the developer to hash out the agreement.</p>
<p>Under its terms, the hotel developer will now hire three-fourths of its employees from the neighborhood for both construction and hotel staff. Employees will earn at least $17 an hour, the <a href="https://logansquarist.com/2019/01/28/real-estate-developer-commits-to-hiring-local-work-force-for-new-hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Logan Squarist reported</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line, Elevated Chicago Helps Heal Deep Divisions</strong></h3>
<p>The way Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s members see it, helping the city to transform development around transit can transform the city as a whole, and this approach can stand as a model for equity, human connection and unity in communities nationwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re providing the table where we can talk and solve some of these problems together,&rdquo; said Requejo. &ldquo;We offer a place where an organizer, a city commissioner, an artist, a developer, and a health provider can all agree on what government, corporations and anchor institutions have done wrong in the past, take collective responsibility to address the racial inequities caused by those actions, and come up with long-term solutions that people can touch and feel.&rdquo;</p>

The terrible tragedy, in conjunction with a groundbreaking report from the <a href="https://www.metroplanning.org/costofsegregation/default.aspx">Metropolitan Planning Council</a>, was a catalyst for the city. Officials were willing to acknowledge race and segregation as root causes of deep issues and their associated costs. This was a cornerstone in Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s application to bring SPARCC dollars to their city. Chicago was identified as a place with both great need and great potential to boost Chicago's Black and Latino residents.</p>
