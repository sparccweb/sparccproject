La Alma, Emanuel Martinez, 1978, La Alma Recreation Center, Denver, Colorado. &quot;La Alma‚Äù is one of the earliest remaining Chicano Murals. The mural commemorates the birthplace of Chicano Mural Movement in Colorado that began at La Alma Lincoln Park neighborhood by Emanuel Martinez with the support of the community. The mural represents the accomplishments of Indigenous and mestizo peoples past and present, as well as the role of the youth to continue their traditions and legacy. The Moon Goddess on the left gazes into Denver‚Äôs urban landscape, while the Earth Goddess on the right gazes towards a Puebloan landscape symbolizing the balance of both.


<h1 dir="ltr">Crusaders For Justice: Continuing Denver&rsquo;s Legacy of Civil Rights to Innovate and Empower</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Following the great California Gold Rush of 1848, migrants, immigrants and others who would come to be known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-Niner">Fifty-Niners </a>set their sights on the Rocky Mountains of what was the western Kansas and southwestern Nebraska territories. Once home to the Apaches, Utes, Cheyennes, Comanches, and Arapahoes Nations, and The Pike&rsquo;s Peak Gold Rush would help to form what is now known as Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This shining city on a mile-high plateau has become one of the most desirable places to live by the young and hip of American society. The city enjoys 300 plus days of sunshine a year which gives you ample time to get out and enjoy the largest city park system in the nation, with 14,000 acres of mountain parks and 2,500 acres of natural areas. This along with noted colleges and universities, four major professional sports teams, and the second largest performing arts center in the world may seem as if the streets were paved with gold. Yet, it would be the fight and spirit of the migrant workers of the 1960s and 70s that would truly shape Denver&rsquo;s legacy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">El Movimento in Denver</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Following the Mexican-American war of 1848, the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/mexican-american-war/treaty-of-guadalupe-hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> promised Mexicans who chose to remain in the newly acquired U.S. territory citizenship and a right to their property, language, and culture. While some tried to assimilate into America seeking to be recognized as a class of &ldquo;white&rdquo;, it became clear to most Mexican Americans that America would once again not keep its promise &mdash; continuing a legacy of discrimination against Black, Brown, and Indigenous people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Out of decades of discriminatory treatment came the Chicano Movement for social and political empowerment. Sparked by three pivotal events in 1969 - the <a href="https://www.historycolorado.org/story/colorado-voices/2019/03/14/guadalupe-briseno-and-female-led-strike-brighton-colorado">Kitayama Carnation strike</a>, the <a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/mexican-american-students-walkout/">West High School walkouts</a>, and the <a href="http://latinopia.com/latino-history/1969-denver-youth-conference/">Denver Chicano Youth Liberation Conference</a>, Denver became the epicenter of this movement. The movement would call for change in multiple parts of American society including labor rights, education reform, and land reclamation. It would introduce some of the greatest civil right leaders such as C&eacute;sar Ch&aacute;vez, Dolores Huerta, Reies Tijerina, and Rodolfo &ldquo;Corky&rdquo; Gonzales.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chicano Movement would spur many reforms including the creation of bilingual and bicultural programs, improved conditions for migrant workers, the hiring of Chicano teachers, and more Mexican-Americans serving as elected officials. These advances were great victories, but these and other struggles would continue for decades to come. The spirit of this movement laid the groundwork for the initiatives that Mile High Connects and SPARCC sought to implement in Denver.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Access to Opportunity Through Transportation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With so many positive things happening in Denver it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to see the inequities that lie just below sea level in this mile-high city. Like many American cities, they face the challenges of bridging the gap between the old and the new, ensuring equitable progress and opportunity, all while addressing the lingering injustices woven into the fabric of this country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drivers of inequity in Denver are both historically rooted and brand new. Like many American cities, racist and discriminatory policies and practices have either blocked or made it extremely difficult for a majority of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people to find jobs that pay a livable wage, safe and affordable housing, quality education, and access to necessary health services. SPARCC, along with partners like Mile High Connects identified a unique thread in Denver that would serve as the linchpin to begin addressing these inequalities &mdash; transportation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that for a city like Denver transportation would be key to the great divide between the haves and the have-nots. Denver is one of the few cities in America that wasn&rsquo;t built on a road, railroad, lake or navigable body of water. Today, it&rsquo;s home to Colfax Avenue, the longest continuous street in America at just over 26 miles, but Denver has a long way to go to close the loop in many of its communities of color.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like many cities, Denver has a history of discriminatory housing policies that redlined Black communities, segregating them into inner-city neighborhoods. Over the years the rapid growth across the Metro Denver region has greatly impacted low-income communities and communities of color. Currently, less than 6 percent of Denver&rsquo;s regional housing is permanently affordable with many low-income families across the region struggling to pay their mortgage or rent every month. After paying for housing costs, there is little left for other essentials like food or childcare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neighborhoods like Five Points and Whittier are now far along in the process of gentrification and have lost much of their cultural identity as more affluent residents displace the original residents driving up property values and property tax burdens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Latino communities on the Northside and throughout West Denver are also in a state of flux. The once-vibrant community has decreased by 40 percent in the past decade. The State of Colorado&rsquo;s constitutionally mandated prohibition on rental regulation of any kind has compounded these issues and sections of the region that had affordable housing have seen rents nearly double.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Disparities among racial and income groups can also be seen in health outcomes as carbon emissions from the highways have led to poor air quality and higher rates of asthma.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While these issues are not exclusive to Denver, so much of it is tied to the city&rsquo;s poor transit model. Transportation is the second largest expense for families, but few consider these costs when choosing a place to live.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Jobs and Economy:</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">266,000 projected jobs over the next 10 years will be middle-skilled jobs across technology, healthcare, and construction. The typical job is accessible to only about 27% of its Denver metropolitan workforce by transit in 90 minutes or less.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Education:</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Less than 10 percent of the metro area&rsquo;s preschools are located within a mile of planned or existing RTD stations and fewer than 3 percent are within half a mile.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">With only 15 percent of Denver&rsquo;s top-performing schools within a mile of an RTD transit station, transportation can be a barrier to low-income families choosing quality school options and for their children to participate in additional learning time, activities, and sports.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Health and Wellness:</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Many basic health services are hard to access via public transportation, making it challenging for low-income families to access the preventive health care, healthy food options, and other resources they need to stay healthy.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Only 16.7% of low-income people living within a half-mile of a transit stop also live more than a half-mile from a grocery store. Limited public transit options, contributing to higher rates of obesity and other chronic diseases</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Innovation Leads to Empowerment</h2>
<p dir="ltr">These harsh realities impressed upon SPARCC and our partners to be intentional about how we would invest in the Denver community. Thankfully, the people of Denver had already begun to make this same commitment. Over the next decade, billions of dollars of public and private sector funding will fuel new investments in transit infrastructure in the Denver Region. In 2004, voters approved FasTracks, a $7.8 billion transit expansion to add 122 miles of railway, 18 miles of bus rapid transit, and more buses serving the regional transit district. As the region&rsquo;s transit system nears completion, the City of Denver has set the most aggressive climate goals in its history. Mile High Connects (MHC) and SPARCC aim to ensure that this multi-billion dollar, tax-funded public investment offers opportunity to all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To date SPARCC has invested in a number of notable projects in the metro Denver area:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">West Denver Single Family ADU -<a href="https://www.mywdrc.org/"> West Denver Renaissance Collaborative</a></h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">$250,000</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The creation of the studio, one-, or two-bedroom units in backyards or over garages provide residents with the ability to earn extra income to cover rising property taxes while providing stable, long-term housing for other families. The ADU program provides a solution to address residents&rsquo; (both homeowners and renters) concerns about displacement. The program also provides an opportunity for intergenerational wealth building. The capital grant was used as a revolving fund for the development funds. The SPARCC innovation grant was used to assist with the costs to create the ADU program and was important in attracting additional capital.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">BuCu West Bottling Plant -<a href="https://www.bucuwest.com/"> BuCu West</a></h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">$165,770, Awarded 2019</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Grant dollars will bridge funding to support a down payment so that BuCu West can put the property under contract and prevent its sale to a buyer that does not share the community&rsquo;s inclusive vision for the neighborhood. The project plans include the expansion of an existing bottling business that currently employs 6 local residents and the creation of a small community center. This new location will allow the bottling business to grow by an estimated 3 or 4 times its current size. The bottling company intends to become a worker-owned cooperative. The small community center will provide space for peer-to-peer educational classes, a community art gallery, and temporary workspaces for local artists/entrepreneurs.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.latinamericanstudies.org/latinos/joaquin.htm">&ldquo;I SHALL ENDURE! I WILL ENDURE!&rdquo;</a></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The SPARCC journey in Denver has been one of successes and failures, of learning and adapting. Despite the many worthwhile projects initiated over the past six years, Mile High Connects closed its doors in June or 2022. But much like the Chicano movement, the spirit of the Crusaders for Justice continues throughout the Denver community and in the work to empower the most vulnerable communities. SPARCC and Mile High Connects are proud of the work done to help Denver innovate and grow, but for it to continue to thrive, Denver must mine its greatest resource &mdash; people. &lsquo;Chicano&rsquo; or &lsquo;Xicano&rsquo; was once considered a racial slur. The Chicano movement flipped the meaning of that word into a term of pride that embraced their full heritage of Indigenous, African, Spanish and European roots. Denver must do the same and embrace the fullness and richness of its varied and diverse communities.</p>

<h1>Fighting Displacement of People and Business in Denver</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p><em>SPARCC&rsquo;s flexible capital helps Denver nonprofits build wealth, stabilize neighborhoods, and minimize displacement</em></p>
<p>In the nonprofit world, it can take up to a year or more to get the money together to fund a program or development. So, when Jose Esparza, executive director of <a href="https://www.bucuwest.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">BuCu West</a> Denver, a local economic development nonprofit, saw an opportunity to help a startup company expand in the predominantly blue-collar, Latino neighborhood of Westwood, he knew what he was up against.</p>
<p>A building had just become available that would be perfect for the growing bottling company, but he needed money to make an offer, and he needed to act fast.</p>
<p>Esparza turned to <a href="http://milehighconnects.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Mile High Connects</a>, the lead organization for <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/communities/denver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SPARCC Denver</a>. Mile High Connects is a coalition of 23 philanthropic, nonprofit, and grassroots organizations in Denver that, through the SPARCC initiative, is able to offer funding and technical assistance to nonprofits. BuCu had received a $165,000 capital grant from SPARCC for a different project that was not yet underway, but Esparza wanted to divert that money for the bottling company building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to see the company grow and become a worker-owned business,&rdquo; said Esparza. It is BuCu&rsquo;s mission to support small, local businesses to benefit the local economy and their &ldquo;compounding effects&rdquo; on neighborhood health, he said.</p>
<p>The answer from SPARCC was a definitive yes. The flexibility of the grant, Esparza said, &ldquo;helped us to quickly respond to an opportunity to expand production of the bottling company.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Keeping Businesses Healthy as a Bulwark Against Cultural Gentrification</strong></h2>
<p>Today the bottling company is preparing to move into the new space, where it will begin bottling everything from marinara to chocolate sauces while helping small startups meet wholesalers&rsquo; demands. Its growth is the kind that BuCu would like to spearhead for other neighborhood businesses.</p>
<p>Another project, <a href="https://www.confluence-denver.com/features/mercado_lineal_morrison_road_011117.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Mercado Lineal</a>, is aiming to do just that. A street beautification and business development project, Mercado Lineal will become a series of small plazas and green spaces for pop-up businesses and others along busy Morrison Road. The project will also make the auto-centric corridor more pedestrian-friendly and vibrant. Seeing the potential of Mercado Lineal to help support local businesses, the city recently passed a bond to fund two-thirds of the streetscape.</p>
<p>Successes like these show how community-based capital can help to prevent the cultural gentrification that happens when locally owned businesses are forced out by rising rents and development pressures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to make sure people feel this is their neighborhood,&rdquo; said Esparza. When a corner store disappears along with the local barbershop and bakery, &ldquo;you start to feel like you don&rsquo;t belong anymore and things are changing too quickly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We look to ownership and keeping things local to fight displacement.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Supporting Granny Flats as a Wealth Builder</strong></h2>
<p>Preventing displacement&mdash;of both businesses and residents&mdash;is a mission of SPARCC and Mile High Connects as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need investment that preserves place and investment that promotes racial equity,&rdquo; said Deyanira Zavala, executive director of Mile High Connects.</p>
<p>In Denver, SPARCC focused initially on the expanding transit system to ensure that any transit-centered development would not displace long-time residents. At the same time, the city was seeing a rapid influx of new residents. &ldquo;Pressures were bubbling to a boiling point,&rdquo; said Zavala.</p>
<p>So, the SPARCC groups turned their attention to local solutions that leveraged local assets through a partnership with the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative (WDRC), which was deploying a community-driven housing strategy to help families find extra income in their back yard and provide new affordable rental units.</p>
<p>Renee Martinez-Stone, WDRC director, describes that &ldquo;resident leaders wanted a housing solution that stabilized homeowners, helped grow wealth, and created new affordable units to offset those lost in the wave of rapidly increasing home values and rental rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being able to remain in one&rsquo;s neighborhood is critical to families as well as the area&rsquo;s economic and cultural health. But as property taxes and other costs rise, families need a budget cushion to stay in their homes. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are one way to provide that cushion. The West Denver Single Family Plus (<em>WDSF+</em>) Accessory Dwelling Unit (<em>ADU</em>) <em>Pilot Program</em> creates a pathway for moderate and low-income families to participate in economic prosperity while staying in the neighborhoods they have made special. The resulting ADUs are rent-restricted and can house extended family members or be rented to bring in extra income.</p>
<p>SPARCC provided <a href="http://www.mywdrc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Denver Renaissance Collaborative</a> (WDRC) a $250,000 grant, which along with a Fannie Mae Sustainable Communities Challenge award, helped launch the ADU Pilot Program. The project offers participating homeowners reduced-cost ADU development (including design, permitting, and construction), personalized housing counseling, and access to new ADU financing. Participants also receive property management training.</p>

<p>Martinez-Stone reports that WDRC has made over 1,100 points of contact through a grassroots effort to inform homeowners about the program through custom meetings, targeted postcards, and old-fashioned door-to-door outreach. &ldquo;One of our key goals is to create equitable access to ADU development in a city that has seen a limited number of ADUs constructed,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>WRDC has leveraged SPARCC funding by spurring new financing partners to create up to $4 million in dedicated funding for custom ADU loans.</p>
<h2><strong>Fighting for Racial Equity Anchors the Work</strong></h2>
<p>Tying all these projects together is a laser-sharp focus on racial equity. After SPARCC was launched in March of 2017, residents and nonprofit organizations around the table at its six sites soon realized that racial equity must be the driving focus of their work. It would be a turning point for many.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we looking at affordable housing and these other issues?&rdquo; asked Zavala. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of the racial inequity of the past and present.&rdquo; It became quickly apparent that a lot of people were hungry to have that conversation about race but there was no place to have it, she said.</p>
<p>In Denver, that perspective is now evident in the city&rsquo;s recent long-term land-use plan, Blueprint Denver. Mile High Connects was active in helping develop the plan, said Zavala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the plan was wrapping up, we introduced an equity lens&rdquo; through which to assess the work, she said. &ldquo;We asked the community planning and development team to think of the plan&rsquo;s long-term impact within that framing&rdquo; to avoid unintended consequences in some of the recommendations and to highlight new solutions.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://milehighcre.com/council-approves-comprehensive-plan-2040-and-blueprint-denver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">city&rsquo;s announcement said</a>, &ldquo;For the first time &mdash; the plans consider social equity factors like vulnerability to displacement, allowing for programs and policies tailored to meet the needs of each neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Learning from One Another</strong></h2>
<p>For Esparza and others at the table, SPARCC brings another benefit&mdash;a &ldquo;brain trust.&rdquo; The six sites that make up SPARCC meet regularly to share ideas, and successes and hear from others doing similar work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so valuable to understand what other cities are advancing and how they&rsquo;re doing it,&rdquo; Esparza said. He took home one idea from Los Angeles that has made business permitting easier for small startups along Morrison Road. And after hearing from organizers in Minneapolis, he is also promoting the Mercado Lineal as a cultural district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understood that culture and creativity were a value in Denver, but we didn&rsquo;t understand that we need to ask our governments to be a player in this because it&rsquo;s a value for the city as a whole as well,&rdquo; Esparza said.</p>
<p>Zavala, too, sees the benefit of sharing ideas and lessons learned, but in this case, the learning goes in both directions. Mile High Connects turned to WDRC &ldquo;to help us understand the landscape in West Denver. We&rsquo;ve taken those lessons and showcased them in other parts of the city with similar opportunities&mdash; to share those pain points and lessons learned in ways that resonate and connect with folks,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<h2><strong> &ldquo;Vouchers of Viability&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>In the end, the projects in Denver are stretching philanthropic and private-sector capital in new ways. The flexibility of the SPARCC funding helped both Esparza and WRDC&rsquo;s accessory dwelling unit program. In addition, having a commitment from a national organization like SPARCC brought a different kind of capital to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a voucher of viability&rdquo; that the project has legs and backing, Zavala said.</p>
<p>The reputation of SPARCC also helped Esparza gain entr&eacute;e to local and national philanthropies, he said, and leverage the money even further. &ldquo;SPARCC expanded our network of connections and made getting conversations with other funders much more doable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We were absolutely more successful because of that.&rdquo; For the broader community development lending world, SPARCC&rsquo;s funding flexibility is showing community development financial institutions (CDFIs) where to expand their pipeline. Community development capital typically helps build things like affordable housing or health clinics in the neighborhood. By using the money for small business development and other smaller projects, SPARCC is both expanding the use of capital and seeding a pipeline of smaller projects that benefits neighborhoods.</p>
