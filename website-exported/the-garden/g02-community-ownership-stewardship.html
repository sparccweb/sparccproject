<h1>Elevating the Role of Community Based Organizations in Federal Funding</h1>


<header>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">Last week Congress passed a $1.5 trillion spending bill that was signed into law by President Biden this week. This comes on the heels of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law last November. While these bills contain funding for very worthwhile programming and resources, these funds often don&rsquo;t make it to the organizations who are doing the work on the ground in our communities like community-based organizations (CBOs).</span></p>
</header>
<article>
<p>There is no one definition of CBOs but generally, they are organizations with an average annual operating budget of $500,000, a median operating budget of $280,000, 10 or fewer employees, and often rely on volunteers to support programming and operations. They often address our most pressing issues including healthcare, job training, economic development, mutual aid, and helping families find or purchase housing and in many cases, avoid evictions.</p>
<p>Despite their generally small size, they have a significant community impact, especially in minority and underserved areas.</p>
<p>The process for allocating dollars from the federal level is often slow and opaque with funds having to pass through state and local entities before they get to where they are most needed. For CBOs, navigating this process can be the difference between surviving and thriving.</p>
<p>So how do we elevate the work of these CBOs so the government recognizes the need to provide resources that make funding streams more accessible to these organizations? SPARCC has made it part of its mission to tackle this issue.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pathways-to-Communtiy-Prosperity.pdf?mc_cid=a8bab1a63f&amp;mc_eid=00101f8e3c">Pathways to Community Prosperity</a> Report, SPARCC articulated the need for public agencies to provide funding to CBOs to help guide local changes needed in communities in both the planning and implementation stages. Last year, Enterprise Advisors conducted 18 interviews in July and August 2021 with small and large CBOs, thought leaders, and subject matter experts to examine how to better serve these organizations in accessing federal funds.</p>
<h3><strong>Break it Down&hellip;</strong></h3>
<p>Through our interviews, we found that CBOs face a lot of barriers when searching for federal dollars. Federal grant applications are complex, with heavy documentation requirements that are challenging for CBOs with small staff to manage. Additionally, requirements are often put in place at the state or local level further complicating application, awarding, and oversight processes. All this red tape and hoops leave a CBO wondering if the juice is even worth the squeeze, even if they are eligible. Yet, from these interviews, we gathered some key takeaways that can close the gap and provide greater access to federal dollars for CBOs.</p>
<h3><strong>Share the Wealth</strong></h3>
<p>The more you know, the more you grow; but you can&rsquo;t grow if you don&rsquo;t know. CBOs face challenges in receiving information about funding opportunities and are often unaware of eligible funding sources. <strong>Providing accessible venues for information exchange about funding opportunities, mentorship, and peer-to-peer exchange will support CBOs through the federal funding application process.</strong> For smaller CBOs it is best to form direct lines of dialogue to inform them of potential funding resources and deadlines.</p>
<h3><strong>If You Build It, They will Come&hellip;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>CBOs will benefit from a shared supportive infrastructure that can guide them through the federal application process.</strong> Regionally scaled organizations are more approachable, especially for smaller CBOs that have limited resources and bandwidth. A regional entity could provide back office and administrative support including application support, legal review, finance, and administrative needs, and other tasks related to compliance reporting requirements. This frees up smaller CBOs to focus on direct work with the communities they serve.</p>
<h3><strong>Gimme A Break</strong></h3>
<p>Federal funding is given to organizations that meet compliance requirements designed to avoid risk, fraud, and abuse of federal funds. While compliance is necessary it creates cumbersome reporting or insurance requirements for small and locally based CBOs. Trying to comply with all the regulations can often offset the positive impact the federal investment may have provided. A CBO may get federal funding to develop and disseminate materials but have to use thousands of dollars of their own money for postage &ndash; these kinds of expenses can break an organization. <strong>Streamlining contracting processes and reporting requirements, waiving some federal requirements, and removing provisional regulations and sub-government requirements will all lend to a more accessible process for CBOs.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Size Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Larger nonprofits often receive funding because of their existing connections with the government and ability to meet the administrative support necessary to fulfill compliance requirements. Yet, larger nonprofits don&rsquo;t always have the local <em>networks or community context understanding that smaller CBOs bring</em>. <strong>Funding opportunities must be segmented based on size, capacity, and/or tenure so that small and medium-sized CBOs are not competing for the same opportunities as larger nonprofits.</strong> Funding set-asides for groups such as small, rural, and underserved communities already exist and provide the blueprint for doing the same for CBOs that represent and/or are better positioned to meet the needs of BIPOC communities in urban and rural areas.</p>
<p>If our government is meant to be by the people and for the people, we must make sure that those community organizations that are working for the people have access to federal funding to create real, grassroots change. CBOs are crucial to that work. Breaking barriers to federal funding is necessary to ensure resources are making it to the organizations that will lift our most marginalized communities in these trying times.</p>

<h1>Advancing Long-Term Community Stewardship Will Be Key to an Equitable and Just Recovery</h1>


<header>
<h1><span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">Housing for all</span></h1>
</header>
<article>
<p><em>We envision a housing system that embraces housing as a critical community infrastructure and as a human right essential to health and well-being. We call for a community-centered, environmentally sustainable, and healthy housing system where everyone has a safe, accessible, and affordable home.<br></em><a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pathways-to-Communtiy-Prosperity.pdf?mc_cid=a8bab1a63f&amp;mc_eid=00101f8e3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>-Our Power: Pathways to Community Prosperity</em></a></p>
<p>Everyone deserves safe, stable, and affordable housing. In a country as wealthy as the United States, this shouldn&rsquo;t be something we have to fight over. Yet <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2020/10/12/property-or-people-the-enduring-legacies-of-racially-discriminatory-housing-policies/">historically</a>, and increasingly as a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/reports/2020/10/30/492606/pandemic-exacerbated-housing-instability-renters-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">result of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, access to this very housing has largely excluded low-income, Black, Indigenous, and people of color. Our country still has not recovered from the recession of 2008 with communities losing a substantial amount of affordable housing to private funds that sell to the highest bidder. The fallout from the imminent evictions crisis looms large on the horizon and, as Congress and the new administration move from relief to recovery planning, it&rsquo;s imperative that recovery is rooted in <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2020/04/22/laying-the-groundwork-for-an-equitable-and-just-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equitable and just principles</a>. Using these principles in partnership with national and local SPARCC partners, we are releasing the <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SPARCC-Long-Term-Community-Stewardship-3.4.2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Advancing Long-Term Community Stewardship</em></a> proposal.</p>
<p><span id="more-3026"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advancing Long-Term Community Stewardship proposes setting aside at least $5 billion in FY2022 to support tenants and maintain local control of assets by supporting small landlords, small business owners in targeted neighborhoods and homeowners.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>&gt;&gt; Read the full proposal <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SPARCC-Long-Term-Community-Stewardship-3.4.2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</h2>
<p>People in communities across the country are facing economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and numerous natural disasters both of which compound the housing cost burden many households face. This includes a looming eviction crisis potentially followed by a spike in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, both of which disproportionately impact Black and Brown communities. It is essential for both short-term relief and longer-term economic recovery funds to strengthen neighborhoods by supporting the people that comprise them. This means preventing the foreclosure of single-family homes, small-scale multi-family units, apartments, and neighborhood commercial properties by providing funding opportunities to retain and increase individual property and collective ownership among community organizations and residents. Funding community stewardship will be key to keeping people in their homes.</p>
<p>The past has taught us that allowing housing robber barons to come and take advantage of existing neighborhoods pushes out low-income and working-class people making way for gentrification. Further, this practice exacerbates the cycle of housing being controlled by investors with limited interests in promoting equitable, climate-resilient, and affordable housing. Creating a mechanism for greater levels of local and affordable ownership by organizations that are explicitly focused on racial equity in their mission would ensure these practices are quelled in the upcoming recovery. Alongside just-cause eviction and supportive tenants' rights policies, local ownership could respond to the accelerating pace of evictions as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Community control could also address longstanding racial and systemic inequities of blight, displacement, and environmental vulnerabilities faced by low-income, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and communities of color everywhere.</p>
<p>Increasing the accessibility of shared-equity residential and business models offers an alternative to the existing extractive community and economic development model by creating more inclusive, culturally attuned, local economies that support keeping people in place if they so choose.</p>
<h3>History as a lesson</h3>
<p>Funding this concept is not new or complicated. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) enacted in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008 laid the groundwork for this idea. It intended to move resources to empower the public sector and private non-profit actors to quickly acquire and control property that housed low and moderate-income families and businesses. This included financial assistance for home purchasers, rehabilitation and redevelopment, and establishment and operation of land banks. These policies are crucial to a full and complete recovery in our communities, but we can do more.</p>
<p>In reimagining an NSP-like program Congress has the opportunity to enact a forward-thinking new source of public funding. The <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SPARCC-Long-Term-Community-Stewardship-3.4.2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Advancing Long-Term Community Stewardship</em></a> proposal recommends providing funds to support tenants and keep local control of assets by supporting small landlords, small business owners in targeted neighborhoods, and homeowners. This would be achieved by prioritizing funding to smaller, community-based organizations led by people of color and focused on racial equity within their mission structure. Additionally, portions of the funding are proposed to be designated for tribal and state governments and competitive grants for qualifying non-profits. This will also protect the most vulnerable in our society including funding for renters from back rent and damaged credit, providing support to homebuyers and small business owners, supporting climate-resilient and healthy housing upgrades, and preserving community assets.</p>
<p>Reimaging NSP and learning from the past implementation has surfaced a few times since its initial inception. The<a href="https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/ProjectRebuildFactSheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Project Rebuild</a> proposal during the Obama administration proposed an allocation of $15 billion to communities in a combination of grants and formulas to rebuild our economy. And more recently, the Affordable Housing Redevelopment Act introduced in February proposes to reinstate NSP at $1.5 billion to help state and local governments purchase abandoned, foreclosed, vacant, or blighted properties and turn them into affordable housing.</p>
<p>While funding for local government is absolutely needed, so is the need to deeply resource community-based organizations, with special attention to those operating with shared equity frameworks. Shared equity models, community land banks, and land trusts would have access to funds in the<a href="https://kaptur.house.gov/sites/kaptur.house.gov/files/documents/Communities%20Left%20Behind%20Act.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Restoring Communities Left Behind Act</a>, which allocates $5 billion to increase homeownership, spur job creation, and increase access to affordable housing. Similarly, <em>Advancing Long-Term Community Stewardship</em> recommends an allocation of $5 billion to retain affordable rental housing, facilitate asset transfers, support water, and energy efficiency improvements, and purchase land and property &ndash; all with the goal of advancing community stewardship.</p>
<p>These proposals and bills can go a long way in supporting community stewardship and yet come with the reality that if not implemented with equity at the center it risks hurting the same communities that need the most support. In the first round of NSP for example, Baltimore and Detroit relied more heavily on using funds for the&nbsp;<a href="https://detroitmi.gov/departments/housing-and-revitalization-department/hud-programs-and-information/neighborhood-stabilization-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demolition of abandoned, vacant, and blighted properties</a>. Numerous properties were torn down with limited planning focused on an equitable re-development in collaboration with the African-American communities that suffered from years of discrimination and disinvestment. A reimagined NSP must account for these lessons and include racial equity accountability mechanisms that are community-led.</p>
<p>Community stewardship is a necessary part of the long-term response to our housing crisis. It focuses on not only housing but the ground underneath. The extraction of land from its original Indigenous stewards, and subsequently from low-income and people of color, continue to be a tool to <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2021/01/29/moving-from-the-inequitable-housing-system-we-have-to-the-housing-system-we-need/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintain racial and economic segregation</a>. Segregation increases inequality in land values, for example in Black and Brown communities land is valued at an average of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/racisms-cost-to-black-homeowners-about-usd48-000-says-study.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$48,000 less</a> than land in white communities. By equitably centering people in communities and holding stewardship as a principle, we also have an opportunity to grow wealth in a more sustainable way&ndash; for people and the planet.</p>
<p>Keeping people in their homes and businesses, and affordable housing providers solvent will be critical to fighting the pandemic. Moreover, promoting just economic recovery, equitable growth of household wealth, and providing funding streams for smaller mission-driven Black and Brown-led community organizations will ensure long-term community prosperity.</p>

<h1>Community Ownership as a Pathway to &ldquo;Build Back Better&rdquo;</h1>


<header>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">As the Biden-Harris administration implements more extensive COVID recovery measures, the importance of &ldquo;building back better&rdquo; has never been clearer. Instead of using recovery funds to return to what was, there is an opportunity to envision something better. This is particularly true in communities most adversely affected by the pandemic&rsquo;s health and economic fallout; these same communities have been long subjected to intentional disinvestment by local, state, and national stakeholders. One pathway to a better future? Community ownership.</span></p>

<p>It is no coincidence that community ownership has risen in prominence in the six major US cities where the SPARCC initiative has partnered with local collaboratives, supported by 300+ organizations, funders, thought partners, and resident experts, over the last four years. These cities have histories of disinvestment, redlining, and gentrification that make Community Ownership a helpful tool to begin the process of community re-building. The collaboratives&rsquo; goals of creating places that lead to equitable and healthy opportunities for everyone naturally align with the key principles of community ownership. In 2020, seeing this alignment and recognizing that community ownership strategies, by definition, mirror the needs and personalities of the neighborhoods, we embarked on an interwoven body of work to better understand and foster community ownership. Through this work, SPARCC staff, consultants, and site practitioners learned together, shaped and informed each other&rsquo;s work, and took a deep dive into community ownership models across the country.</p>
<h3>What exactly <em>is </em>community ownership?</h3>
<p>Historically in the US, property ownership has been defined by legal, financial, and social exclusion. This reality has stolen Indigenous sovereignty on ancestral lands, created and amplified a racial wealth gap, kept working people perpetually segregated and politically marginalized, and helped ensure that one of the best determinants of a child&rsquo;s future is his zip code.</p>
<p>The idea of community ownership is a straightforward concept&mdash;a community owns the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; (usually property) under consideration. The community then must determine which of the many forms of community ownership fits its needs. It can include collective ownership of land and buildings through land trusts and co-operatives; it can also include entrepreneurial and cooperative ownership of the businesses that might occupy them. Community ownership envisions opening the ownership of homes, commercial property, and backyard cottages to the people who have built and who maintain the culture of the community. It also opens a pathway for low-income and people of color to local control of community assets. It contemplates the way that people build resilient networks, expand political power, protect, and elevate shared culture, and seed personal wealth. <em>Click the icon in the bottom right corner to expand for a better view.</em></p>

<p>The diagram above is an illustration of community ownership; it is the result of several iterations, many conversations with our local partners, and lots of research. The diagram holds space for ownership in many forms. Moreover, it considers how to make these visions into reality, pointing out roles for information exchange, capital investment, public partnership, and community leadership.</p>
<h3>What We&rsquo;ve Learned</h3>
<p>SPARCC partnered with national leaders at the <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Displacement Project</a> to understand the drivers of displacement through <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2020/11/10/driving-national-anti-displacement-strategies-from-the-ground-up/">data and lived experience</a>. In the last few years of working together, we have come to see how community ownership might create freedom from the pervasive fear of displacement and desire for a more geographically and financially certain future&mdash; a desire that cuts across hot real estate markets and chronically disinvested places.</p>
<h4>LEVEL SETTING AND INFORMATION SHARING</h4>
<p>We hosted a series of webinars designed to invite experts and community leaders from different cities to share their experience, expertise, and community ownership models:</p>

</ul>
<h4>STRIVING FOR EFFICIENCY AND IMPACT</h4>
<p>Through our research partnership with <a href="https://www.communityscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Science</a>, we convened leaders in community ownership across the country and determined where to devote research capacity. At the direction of these leaders, CS pulled together (1) a foundational lit review document to help residents and new leaders understand the basics of community ownership and (2) a research document to identify the leading edge of collaborative efforts among CLTs designed to share resources and networks for greater impact.</p>

<h4>FEDERAL INVESTMENT PROPOSAL</h4>
<p>Developed in partnership with SPARCC sites, housing, community development, and community ownership advocates, the <em>Advancing Long Term Community Stewardship</em> proposal reimagines the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) as a way to stabilize renters and preserve at-risk personal wealth in communities of color. Read more about the proposal <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2021/03/05/advancing-long-term-community-stewardship-will-be-key-to-an-equitable-and-just-recovery/">here</a>.</p>
<h4>LOS ANGELES CLT INVESTMENT</h4>
<p>A group of five community land trusts and their development partners came together to raise shared operating funds (in the form of grants) and <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/what-happened-when-activists-took-over-vacant-homes-in-los-angeles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$14M in public investment from LA County for CLTs</a>. The SPARCC staff and local collaborative partners set up systems to formalize these partnerships, manage risk on property acquisition, and provide flexible risk capital to get properties under contract, all paving the way to put the county&rsquo;s CLT funding allocation into action.

<h3>Where We&rsquo;re Going</h3>
<p>Our work with community ownership does not end here. We will take time over the next few months to share more about how SPARCC partners are envisioning community ownership in their own communities, dive deeper into key takeaways from our research paper, and more.</p>
