<h1>RESEARCH: Equitable Capital, Experiments in Building a Finance System for All</h1>


<p>The current financial system rewards the well-resourced and fails most BIPOC and low-income Americans. It simultaneously throws billions of dollars at unprofitable Silicon Valley companies while making capital inaccessible for small businesses and Main Street entrepreneurs. It has also done nothing to close our shameful racial wealth gap&ndash;indeed, <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2019/01/29/book-review-the-color-of-money-black-banks-and-the-racial-wealth-gap-by-mehrsa-baradaran/">it has made it worse</a>. People across the country are yearning for a new system that promotes equity and provides capital to individuals, businesses and community-based organizations that are not well-served by large financial institutions. The good news is that many people, companies, and organizations are working hard to build the foundations of this different financial system. Capital For Communities is a consulting firm that helps mission-driven organizations conceptualize, develop, and implement programs to raise and deploy capital to achieve their goals. Along with The Sankofa Group, we partnered with SPARCC to research these emerging capital products and approaches, focusing on real estate capital, and found common threads across the work.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Community Ownership&nbsp;Collaborations for&nbsp;Resilience and Impact</h1>


<p>As part of SPARCC's ongoing work in community ownership, we partnered with Community Science to research the field of community ownership and explore: what is community ownership? who is already practicing models of community ownership? and what are the various models of community ownership?</p>

<h1>SPARCC's Community Ownership Peer Learning Series: Summary and Key Insights</h1>


<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the fall of 2022, building on previous research, advocacy, webinars and grantmaking to support<br>community ownership models, SPARCC convened a four-part series that brought together leaders<br>from all six SPARCC metro areas for shared learning and support. Through workshops, peer<br>presentations, and discussion, the series sought to distill key aspects, challenges, and lessons from<br>the field related to four components of the community ownership ecosystem - Collaborative<br>Networks, Resident Leadership, Policy, and Financing Strategies. This document summarizes the key<br>insights and highlights from this series and is intended to serve as a handy reference for revisiting<br>and contextualizing our collective learnings.</p>

<h1>REPORT: Inclusive Investment Starts With Equitable Engagement</h1>
</header>


<a href="assets/files/EECEV4-1.jpg">EECEV4-1.jpg</a>


<p>Public planning processes have evolved in recent years from being a one-time, mostly one-way effort to inform the community about a proposed investment or policy change, i.e., a new highway project or a zoning change, to more community involvement to shape and design projects and policies.</p>
<p>Equitable community engagement practices can take this even further to create deeper two-way learning and conversation between public agencies and community representatives.</p>
<h3>Read the report <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EECE-V4.pdf">here</a>.</h3>
<p>This report, written with the input of various SPARCC partners, offers a set of lessons learned and specific strategies public agencies and others can deploy to resource local organizations and engage traditionally underrepresented community members as partners to shape community development policies, plans and investments.</p>
<p>One such example is in Chicago, with Elevated Chicago &ndash; the SPARCC collaborative &ndash; in its work in the new administration of Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Roberto Requejo, its program director, described it this way:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;As our community-based partners developed their bricks-and-mortar priorities for equitable development near transit hubs, we asked them to also identify challenges in community engagement and solutions to them. What started as an informal list of issues and suggestions ended up becoming a formal paper on Principles and Recommendations for Community Engagement co-created by 20+ civic and community leaders and recently adopted by Mayor Lori Lightfoot&rsquo;s Office and the Chicago Department of Public Health. The power of what our community-based partners could do with SPARCC support was astounding and will lead to real change in a system rife with inequities that hurt some communities, in particular, and the fabric of the city as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
<cite>-Roberto Requejo, Elevated Chicago</cite></blockquote>


<h1>REPORT: Parking a Major Barrier to Equitably Oriented Transit</h1>


<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that there are as many as two billion parking spots in the United States, while there are 200 million cars on the road. Cars cruising for on-street parking in U.S. cities contribute significantly to congestion and pollution, and parking covers huge amounts of urban land area. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; parking increases housing and consumer costs because parking is subsidized by consumers. Traditional parking policies can be especially detrimental in lower-income communities. This new report, initiated by <a href="http://www.elevatedchicago.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elevated Chicago</a>, explores reforms and their (serious) unintended consequences, especially if low-income households are not considered in their design.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways from SPARCC and Urban Displacement Project&rsquo;s Gentrification and Displacement Analysis</h2>
<p>By Devin Culbertson, Enterprise Community Partners and Renee Roy Elias, Urban Displacement Project</p>
<p><span id="more-2949"></span></p>
<p>Cities are in a unique moment in modern history. Economic inequality and racial bias persistently inhibit the ability for working people to find safe and stable housing. Disinvestment and poor maintenance are deteriorating once great neighborhoods to a degree that threatens basic habitability. The COVID-19 pandemic is reshaping our systems of commerce, mobility and social interaction, while dramatically underscoring that housing IS health. And most importantly, protest and economic necessity are changing the way that we talk about race, what we expect from our institutions, and the way we provide for each other in time of extreme need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this crucial moment for the future of American cities and cultural hubs, we must understand the factors that drive displacement and prevent people from staying connected to their place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research and local conversations about large-scale displacement have been happening in many cities &ndash;not just the &ldquo;hot market&rdquo; usual suspects like New York and San Francisco&mdash;for nearly a decade. <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2020/11/10/driving-national-anti-displacement-strategies-from-the-ground-up/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Other than an occasional cautionary tale, local conversations between residents, advocates and leaders have typically focused on their own city.</p>
<p>In 2018, SPARCC partnered with the UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Urban Displacement Project (UDP) and community partners to analyze gentrification and displacement patterns in the Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, and Memphis SPARCC regions. The goal of this project was to understand the commonalities and differences in their respective neighborhood change patterns across regions in order to build momentum for a national narrative around anti-displacement. This two-year community-engaged research process culminated in a set of interactive gentrification and displacement maps of <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/maps/atlanta-gentrification-and-displacement">Atlanta,</a> <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/maps/chicago-gentrification-and-displacement">Chicago</a>, <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/maps/denver-gentrification-and-displacement">Denver</a>, and <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/maps/memphis-gentrification-and-displacement">Memphis</a> and two accompanying reports, <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/udp_replication_project_methodology_10.16.2020-converted.pdf">The Urban Displacement Replication Project</a> and <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/building_a_national_narrative_october_2020-converted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building a National Narrative of Anti-Displacement Strategies.</a></p>

<h1>Igniting Systems Change</h1>
</header>


<p>By Stephanie Gidigbi</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/resources/igniting-systems-change/" target="blank">The Systems Change Guide</a> explores several key SPARCC concepts and approaches to advance systems change. It spotlights regional efforts and serves as a guide to actualize systems change from theory to reality. It also includes an appendix of tools &amp; resources to assess and prioritize systems change activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research shows that place as well as race matter and that both impact life expectancy and social economic mobility. While recent attention has been paid to cities experiencing rapid economic growth and development, less is reported about the vast majority seeing higher and more concentrated rates of poverty.</p>
<p>We live in a society of interconnected systems, structured by the &ldquo;norms&rdquo; of an America built on class and race. From our roads to our homes, social inequities are embedded in the concrete of our foundation as a nation. Government policies from the 1950s, such as redlining, continue to negatively impact communities of color &ndash; a situation that puts many once-thriving neighborhoods and regions at a competitive disadvantage. Highways divide us from our neighbors because of infrastructure built on American inequality and our collective investment in structural racism that devalues the moral and economic fabric of the country.</p>
<p>If current and past development trends remain the same, patterns of segregation, concentrated poverty and displacement will fail to meet the needs of America&rsquo;s increasingly diverse population. However, there is an opportunity to disrupt the status quo and produce better outcomes for everyone. Over the next decade, the public sector alone will invest trillions of dollars in communities across the country to help reshape the built environment.</p>
<p>As a nation, we simply can&rsquo;t afford more of the same failed approaches &ndash; economically, socially or environmentally. We must divest from the systemic inequalities that divide us and invest in equitable development&mdash;a range of approaches for creating healthy, vibrant, and sustainable communities where residents of all incomes, races, and ethnicities have access to transportation options, affordable homes, clean air and water, and basic rights to thrive.</p>
<p>Achieving racial equity requires an intentional commitment and inclusive approach that supports the empowerment of people to transform systems that allocate power and resources, in order to create communities where all people, regardless of race or origin, have equitable access to thrive.</p>
<p>The Strong Prosperous and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC) ignites a systems change approach for altering the status quo through innovative practices and inclusive policy solutions that influence and institutionalize how communities plan, design and invest in community development projects to achieve a broader range of racial justice, health, climate, and community benefits. SPARCC seeks to advance an <strong>integrated vision for the future that considers and holistically addresses the interrelated root causes of racial inequity, health disparities, and climate vulnerabilities.</strong></p>
