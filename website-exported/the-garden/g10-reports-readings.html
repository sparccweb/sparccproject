<p>Public planning processes have evolved in recent years from being a one-time, mostly one-way effort to inform the community about a proposed investment or policy change, i.e., a new highway project or a zoning change, to more community involvement to shape and design projects and policies.</p>
<p>Equitable community engagement practices can take this even further to create deeper two-way learning and conversation between public agencies and community representatives.</p>
<h3>Read the report <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EECE-V4.pdf">here</a>.</h3>
<p>This report, written with the input of various SPARCC partners, offers a set of lessons learned and specific strategies public agencies and others can deploy to resource local organizations and engage traditionally underrepresented community members as partners to shape community development policies, plans and investments.</p>
<p>One such example is in Chicago, with Elevated Chicago &ndash; the SPARCC collaborative &ndash; in its work in the new administration of Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Roberto Requejo, its program director, described it this way:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;As our community-based partners developed their bricks-and-mortar priorities for equitable development near transit hubs, we asked them to also identify challenges in community engagement and solutions to them. What started as an informal list of issues and suggestions ended up becoming a formal paper on Principles and Recommendations for Community Engagement co-created by 20+ civic and community leaders and recently adopted by Mayor Lori Lightfoot&rsquo;s Office and the Chicago Department of Public Health. The power of what our community-based partners could do with SPARCC support was astounding and will lead to real change in a system rife with inequities that hurt some communities, in particular, and the fabric of the city as a whole.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Parking a Major Barrier to Equitably Oriented Transit</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that there are as many as two billion parking spots in the United States, while there are 200 million cars on the road. Cars cruising for on-street parking in U.S. cities contribute significantly to congestion and pollution, and parking covers huge amounts of urban land area. &ldquo;Free&rdquo; parking increases housing and consumer costs because parking is subsidized by consumers. Traditional parking policies can be especially detrimental in lower-income communities. This new report, initiated by <a href="http://www.elevatedchicago.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elevated Chicago</a>, explores reforms and their (serious) unintended consequences, especially if low-income households are not considered in their design.</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways from SPARCC and Urban Displacement Project&rsquo;s Gentrification and Displacement Analysis</h3>
<p>By Devin Culbertson, Enterprise Community Partners and Renee Roy Elias, Urban Displacement Project</p>
<p><span id="more-2949"></span></p>
<p>Cities are in a unique moment in modern history. Economic inequality and racial bias persistently inhibit the ability for working people to find safe and stable housing. Disinvestment and poor maintenance are deteriorating once great neighborhoods to a degree that threatens basic habitability. The COVID-19 pandemic is reshaping our systems of commerce, mobility and social interaction, while dramatically underscoring that housing IS health. And most importantly, protest and economic necessity are changing the way that we talk about race, what we expect from our institutions, and the way we provide for each other in time of extreme need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this crucial moment for the future of American cities and cultural hubs, we must understand the factors that drive displacement and prevent people from staying connected to their place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research and local conversations about large-scale displacement have been happening in many cities &ndash;not just the &ldquo;hot market&rdquo; usual suspects like New York and San Francisco&mdash;for nearly a decade. <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2020/11/10/driving-national-anti-displacement-strategies-from-the-ground-up/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Other than an occasional cautionary tale, local conversations between residents, advocates and leaders have typically focused on their own city.</p>
<p>In 2018, SPARCC partnered with the UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Urban Displacement Project (UDP) and community partners to analyze gentrification and displacement patterns in the Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, and Memphis SPARCC regions. The goal of this project was to understand the commonalities and differences in their respective neighborhood change patterns across regions in order to build momentum for a national narrative around anti-displacement. This two-year community-engaged research process culminated in a set of interactive gentrification and displacement maps of <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/atlanta/gentrification-and-displacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlanta,</a> <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/chicago/gentrification-and-displacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago</a>, <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/denver/gentrification-and-displacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denver</a>, and <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/memphis/gentrification-and-displacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memphis</a> and two accompanying reports, <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/udp_replication_project_methodology_10.16.2020-converted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Urban Displacement Replication Project</a> and <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/building_a_national_narrative_october_2020-converted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building a National Narrative of Anti-Displacement Strategies.</a></p>

</div>
<h2>What We Learned</h2>
<p>Rather than attempting to rank cities, or determine where displacement pressure is most acute, as has been a common focus of recent research, this work aims to understand the spectrum of disinvestment, stability, gentrification and exclusion through multiple perspectives in multiple cities. Gentrification and displacement patterns may look different across Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, and Memphis but this sample of American cities identifies some common challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Racialized patterns of neighborhood change persist,</li>
<li>New investment particularly in urban greening projects is perpetuating displacement,</li>
<li>Disinvestment continues to threaten the livelihoods of low-income communities and communities of color,</li>
<li>Displacement is impacting the social determinants of health due to loss of community resources, social networks, and educational opportunities, and</li>
<li>Climate change is expected to exacerbate ongoing displacement.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding the experiences of neighborhood change and responsive policy approaches in many places, this work aims to empower communities to learn from one another&rsquo;s displacement stories, acknowledge their connections, legitimize their experiences in the eyes of federal and local policymakers and elected officials, and engage with best practices in anti-displacement interventions from around the country.</p>
<h2><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></h2>
<p>Geoff Smith, Executive Director, DePaul University Institute of Housing Studies highlights that, &ldquo;The maps UDP developed can serve as an important tool for facilitating cross-city discussions and information-sharing among community partners working in similar neighborhood contexts.&rdquo; SPARCC is providing the ongoing infrastructure for practitioner and community leaders across these six cities to learn from each other and build a stronger voice together.</p>
<p>For policy advocates and grass tops organizations already working at the national level, these key elements of displacement offer a way to understand the common displacement pressures across cities, and craft federal policy responses and replicable programs that can respond to what we understand as a systemic problem that transcends individual regions.</p>

<p>Many cities around the country are struggling with the same question: How do we invest in ways that help to curb greenhouse gas emissions without displacing residents? The stakes of this question are high: Displacement has <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/pushedout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">lasting impacts</a> on <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/impacts_of_displacement_in_san_mateo_county.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">physical and psychological wellbeing</a>, <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/blog/displacement-impacts-santa-clara" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">community cohesion</a>, and <a href="http://www.rajchetty.com/chettyfiles/movers_paper1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">long-term economic mobility</a>. Moreover, when low-income people of color are displaced from communities by rising housing prices, we often see patterns of <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/research#section-209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">re-segregation</a> emerge, deepening racial inequity in our regions.</p>
<p>Although anti-displacement policies and toolkits abound, cities are realizing that there are no simple solutions to this seemingly intractable problem. We&rsquo;ve been studying gentrification and displacement patterns in California and around the country for six years. Currently, we are working with SPARCC to replicate our <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/map/sf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">gentrification and displacement typology maps</a> in <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/communities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SPARCC sites</a>, and work toward building a cross-context national narrative of gentrification and displacement.

<p>Activists have long <a href="https://www.publicadvocates.org/our-work-2/housing/investment-without-displacement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">advocated</a> for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WCkpjRTcRx_HasrCdMh0mKdJ_SfQn3wu/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">investment without displacement</a>, or <a href="https://cjjc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/development-without-displacement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">development without displacement</a>, in our cities and communities. This <a href="http://greenlining.org/publications/online-resources/2019/equity-lab-toolkit-development-without-displacement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">framework</a> &ndash; which was explored in depth at the <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/displacement/iwd-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SPARCC Investment Without Displacement convening</a> last year &ndash; recognizes that investments, both public and private, can spark and fuel displacement and can transform not only the built environment, but also who is able to live in the area. For example, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/transit-oriented-displacement-or-community-dividends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">our research</a> shows that neighborhoods with rail stations are more likely to gentrify than areas without a transit stop. Researchers also find that environmental cleanups and amenities like parks can increase property values, changing the composition of the neighborhood &ndash; this is often called &ldquo;green gentrification.&rdquo; Because of this, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/livable-city/la-oe-christensen-parks-green-gentrification-20181012-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">communities around the country</a> are becoming concerned that any investment will lead to displacement.</p>
<p>Researchers still have many unanswered questions about how and when investments drive displacement. However, cities should not avoid investing in their communities in order to avoid displacement. Instead, cities should adopt anti-displacement policies and frameworks as they invest. The question should not be whether to invest or not, but rather, how can investments be leveraged to ensure residents get to stay by choice and reap the benefits of new amenities, increased accessibility, and more resources?</p>
<p>To start, being proactive is critical &ndash; cities need to center equitable development and anti-displacement as they plan for new investments. It is important to plan and adopt policies and programs <em>before</em> the investment is even announced instead of after, when prices have already risen and people have already been displaced. At the same time, cities need to be <em>responsive </em>to ongoing gentrification and displacement pressures while they are working to avoid those forces in the future. And anti-displacement policy strategies must consider the varied drivers of displacement &ndash; changing regional housing trends, exclusionary markets, poverty, income inequality, and disinvestment <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0885412217716439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">can all lead to displacement</a>. Below we provide a series of strategies that follow the widely used <em>three P&rsquo;s</em> anti-displacement framework: tenant protections, production of affordable housing, and preservation of affordable housing. Within each section we provide examples of proactive and responsive strategies. A more comprehensive list of anti-displacement policy strategies can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1FUmXPewMjUySTfBcQxNXDd1BbwnQ-D5vhESMgDPTw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Protections</h2>
<p>With ever-rising rents and eviction pressures, tenant protections are needed to help residents stay in place in the face of myriad <a href="http://urbandisplacement.org/pushedout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">displacement pressures</a>. Proactive strategies protect tenants from rent hikes via rent stabilization, and from arbitrary evictions by requiring that landlords have a &ldquo;just cause&rdquo; to evict. These two strategies need to go hand-in-hand to be effective. Due to the ever-deepening housing affordability crisis, <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2019/04/23/rent-control-is-at-a-turning-point/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">campaigns</a> have emerged around the country to expand rent regulation, including efforts to reform or repeal state restrictions &ndash; in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5918775-Rent-Control-FAQ-Presser-Draft.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Seattle</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/02/27/698509957/oregon-set-to-pass-the-first-statewide-rent-control-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Portland</a>, <a href="https://www.acceaction.org/keepfamilieshome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">California</a>, and <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/30/rent-control-bill-colorado-senate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Colorado</a>. Debate continues about the pros and cons of rent regulations including their potential impacts on housing production and quality, but the impact on sitting tenants is clear: turnover and economic displacement is reduced for residents of rent-regulated units (Zuk, forthcoming).</p>
<p>Responsive strategies are also key. One increasingly popular effort is guaranteeing tenant right to counsel in evictions cases &ndash; cases tenants would likely lose without proper representation, which many low-income tenants are unlikely able to afford. <a href="http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/policy-minute-access-to-counsel-and-other-strategies-to-prevent-displacemen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">New York City</a> and <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/tenant-advocacy-groups-set-to-receive-funding-under-right-to-counsel-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">San Francisco</a> are both experimenting with such programs and a number of other cities, including <a href="http://planphilly.com/articles/2019/05/09/philly-renters-guaranteed-lawyers-in-eviction-court-under-new-city-council-bill?utm_source=Next+City+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=4d21d20eff-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_21_05_47_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_fcee5bf7a0-4d21d20eff-44220229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Philadelphia</a>, are considering them. In Chicago, the Lawyers&rsquo; Committee for Better Housing found that having a lawyer decreases a tenant&rsquo;s odds of getting evicted <a href="https://eviction.lcbh.org/reports/legal-aid-attorneys-make-the-difference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">by about 25%</a>. Assessments of the first two years of the program in New York City find that while eviction rates have decreased, thousands of evictions are still <a href="https://thecity.nyc/2019/05/thousands-evicted-even-in-areas-with-free-lawyers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">being carried out</a>. More research is needed to understand how responsive strategies can most effectively keep people in their homes.</p>
<h2>Production</h2>
<p>In terms of strategies to prevent future displacement, the production of permanently affordable housing is among the most effective. Our <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">research</a> finds that subsidized housing is twice as effective as market-rate housing in mitigating displacement. Proactively, acquiring land for affordable housing production before a major investment is announced is a smart strategy to promote neighborhood affordability. For example, in a unique case, TriMet in Portland <a href="https://prrac.org/pdf/EquitableTOD.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">acquired and banked land</a> adjacent to a light rail expansion, which the agency later dedicated to subsidized affordable housing development, using transit money and federal funds.</p>
<p>In many U.S. cities, new housing production is needed to address the supply and demand mismatch.To this end, policymakers <a href="https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">around</a> <a href="https://www.sightline.org/2019/02/25/heres-what-oregons-huge-new-transit-housing-bill-would-legalize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the</a> <a href="https://www.lacity.org/blog/city-planning-releases-measure-jjj-and-transit-oriented-communities-housing-progress-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">country</a> are looking to zoning reform and permitting processes to help ramp up production. In <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/blog/upzoning-california-what-are-implications-sb-50-bay-area-neighborhoods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">our brief</a> on California&rsquo;s upzoning bill (SB 50) we highlight core equitable development considerations for any strategy that seeks to ramp up production. For example, increased land value should be captured for public benefit. One way to do this is to open up high-opportunity neighborhoods to low-income households. At the same time, efforts should be made to stabilize neighborhoods as new developments take root.</p>
<p>In terms of responsive policy, when affordable housing is produced, preference or right-to-return policies are often considered. These policies offer housing opportunities to those who have already been displaced so they can return to their communities. Such policies are in place in a number of cities, including <a href="https://beta.smgov.net/strategic-goals/inclusive-diverse-community/affordable-housing-production-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Santa Monica</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/housing/forapplicants/rentalapplicantpool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Cambridge</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/09/23/495237494/feds-to-allow-preferences-for-low-income-applicants-in-s-f-housing-complex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">San Francisco</a>, and others. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/01/portland-anti-gentrification-housing-scheme-right-return" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Portland&rsquo;s North/Northeast Preference Policy</a> is an innovative example that seeks to recognize and address historic injustices of displacement through urban renewal in historically black North/Northeast Portland. Through this policy, residents receive preference in affordable units in the area if they, their parents or grandparents have a current or former address in that zone, as well as if a member of the family had property seized through urban renewal.</p>
<h2>Preservation</h2>
<p>Preservation of existing affordable housing stock can help keep neighborhoods more affordable. Preserving existing units is often more cost-effective than building new affordable housing and can be a good fit in places that are already built out. Preservation can be leveraged in the lead-up to an investment to remove land from the speculative market, establish long-term affordability, and help stabilize neighborhoods. For example, in anticipation of rising housing costs in the Globeville and Elyria-Swansea neighborhoods of Denver, a neighborhood coalition started a <a href="https://www.cpr.org/news/story/globeville-elyria-swansea-isn-t-interested-in-gentrification-they-want-change-on-their" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">community land trust</a>, leveraging funds from the Colorado Department of Transportation. Community land trusts acquire land and maintain ownership permanently, with prospective homeowners entering into long-term renewable leases of the land and getting the chance to build some wealth and equity. <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/working-papers/role-community-land-trusts-fostering-equitable-transit-oriented" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Research</a> points to community land trusts as a potential strategy in equitable transit-oriented developments; and the role of public agencies in facilitating land acquisition and funding can be critical.</p>
<p>Preservation can also be done responsively, where the threat of displacement triggers strategic acquisition/rehabilitation for long-term affordability. For example, in San Francisco&rsquo;s <a href="https://sfmohcd.org/small-sites-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Small Sites program</a>, lower-income tenants in small buildings can nominate their building for acquisition/rehabilitation by nonprofits. The program actively seeks to support residents facing displacement pressure; as of 2016, 30% of the people whose units were acquired and stabilized were under active evictions proceedings (which were stopped through this program). In Washington D.C., the <a href="https://dhcd.dc.gov/service/tenant-opportunity-purchase-assistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act</a>, gives right of first refusal to tenants who are threatened with displacement because their building is up for sale. Tenants can either purchase or assign purchase rights to a nonprofit, enabling them to form cooperatives and condo associations that provide ongoing ownership. Since 2015, over 1,400 units have been preserved through the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act.</p>

<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>Considering a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1FUmXPewMjUySTfBcQxNXDd1BbwnQ-D5vhESMgDPTw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">menu of policies</a> across the <em>three P&rsquo;s</em>, including both proactive and responsive strategies, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of guiding principles that can help cities and advocates prioritize solutions best suited to their context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand your community</strong>: Data and analysis are critical to understanding what is happening in communities and to ensuring that strategies are tailored to their needs. What stage of change are neighborhoods in? In what condition is the housing stock? What kinds of pressures are residents facing? Analyzing available data, and collecting information by talking to residents, realtors, developers, community groups, etc., is the first step to understanding what&rsquo;s needed and can help find a balance between proactive and responsive strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Engage the community in the design and implementation of solutions</strong>: Early warning systems are helpful but should not replace engaging community groups to better understand what residents&rsquo; most pressing challenges are and what support they need to be able to stay in their homes and communities. Partnerships are also critical for implementation. For example, in D.C., ten community-based organizations are contracted by the City to do outreach around the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Program. These organizations make sure tenants are aware of, and can access, their right to acquire or allow a nonprofit to acquire their building.</li>
<li><strong>Get ahead of investments and change</strong>: Property appreciation and speculation happen rapidly after investments have been announced; once that market signaling has happened, it can feel like it&rsquo;s already too late to stem the tide of displacement pressures. It is therefore imperative to implement policies and carefully consider how to minimize displacement impacts long before investments are made public.</li>
<li><strong>Consider scale</strong>: How does the scale of the solution compare to the scale of the issue? How many households are at risk versus how many households would be affected by a suite of interventions?</li>
<li><strong>Implementation doesn&rsquo;t happen on its own</strong>: With any policy, there is a difference between what&rsquo;s on the books and what is enforced. It is essential to design and fund strong enforcement mechanisms in anti-displacement policies. For example, rent regulation programs should have the resources to establish rental registries and proactively follow up on information they collect. This can make all the difference for a household on the verge of being priced out of a home.</li>
<li><strong>Organizing is key:</strong> Community organizing is key in getting good-fit policies passed in the first place. Organizing can also ensure long-term accountability so that policies go beyond checking a box and actually lead to meaningful outcomes for residents.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget how we got here: </strong>We must <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/gentrification-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">recognize history</a>, and the realities and <a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/redlining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">legacies of racist urban policy</a> in order to address historical injustices. One example of this is the fight to identify &ldquo;sensitive communities,&rdquo; where implementation of California&rsquo;s proposed SB 50 upzoning policy would be deferred during a community planning process. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13M7J1OkqzhjnXyEYW5DMJM5IPhxqIvXriMiS1ISpb8k/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Advocates have insisted</a> that communities that have been most burdened by discriminatory policies &ldquo;deserve sufficient time and self-determination to plan for an inclusive future for their neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>While anti-displacement work can feel like an uphill battle, there is hope. There has been a dramatic increase in the recognition of the problems of gentrification and displacement over the last five years. This comes coupled with an increase in organizing and coalition-building work. The <em>three P&rsquo;s</em> are taking off; because there are no silver bullets for equitable development, policies must combine protections, preservation, and production. Decision-makers and community leaders must come together to understand how these approaches can work in conjunction in a specific community. If the right people are involved &ndash; particularly those who are most likely to be affected &ndash; large campaigns, regardless of their overall success, can provide the foundation for a community&rsquo;s future organizing and planning efforts.</p>
<p>We believe everyone has a right to live in a place where they are safe, feel a sense of belonging, and where they have access to good schools, healthy food, public transit, nearby employment opportunities, green space, and other building blocks of a healthful, fulfilling life. When communities are at the table in planning processes, armed with accessible data and knowledge about effective policy strategies, they can help ensure investments are leveraged to create more inclusive futures.</p>

<h1>Opportunity Zones: Who benefits?</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p>By Stephanie Gidigbi, Sasha Forbes, and Marissa Ramirez</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Strong, Prosperous, And Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC) has collaborated with LOCUS Developers on a <a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/program/locus/opportunity-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Opportunity Zone Report</a> that highlights the social equity and vulnerability of designated opportunity zones with key recommendations for public and private sector leaders. The report identifies which Opportunity Zones are positioned to bring positive social, environmental, and economic returns, ranking them by their smart growth potential and social equity. It also, includes policy recommendations for communities to advance more just, healthy, equitable and climate resilient projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than 30 million people live in designated Opportunity Zones added to the tax code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, intended to spur economic development in low-income urban and rural communities by providing tax benefits to investors.</p>
<p>The designations come with prospects of great opportunity and great challenge, prompting community advocates and public officials to consider the often inequitable outcomes of investment in low-income communities by asking the question, &ldquo;Who benefits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>History has repeatedly demonstrated that investment without protective equitable policy and process mechanisms leads to gentrification and the subsequent displacement of residents in low-income and communities of color.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1575" src="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Community-Photo-LA-Watts.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" srcset="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Community-Photo-LA-Watts.jpg 685w, https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Community-Photo-LA-Watts-300x225.jpg 300w" alt="" width="685" height="514"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report comes as the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/politics/trump-opportunity-zones-tax-cut.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a new executive order</a> instructing federal agencies with grants and loan programs to prioritize Opportunity Zone projects in which investors such as banks or hedge funds can set up a Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) to provide start-up capital for new businesses in designated areas, support the expansions of existing ones, and invest in real estate development or neighborhood infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Department of the Treasury has certified approximately 8,700 Opportunity Zones in low-income, rural, high-poverty census tracts covering parts of all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. By comparison, Congress only authorized 40 empowerment zones, 40 renewal communities, and 65 Enterprise Communities (ECs) in previous designations for highly distressed communities.</p>
<p>In addition, eligible Opportunity Zone projects can include investments such as residential rental property businesses, which were excluded by earlier programs. This difference in the scale of the past designations underscores even further the need for cities and advocates to act swiftly in developing people-based policies that can chart a new model that is not based on displacement-fueled development.</p>
<p>The designation <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenrosenthal/2018/08/20/opportunity-zones-may-help-investors-and-syndicators-more-than-distressed-communities/#40eb8f5676f2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idea may not be new</a>, but the impact of this latest iteration could be significant to local communities.</p>
<p>The Opportunity Zone designation can offer an opportunity for communities to develop their own vision for investments and implement protective policies to <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/sasha-forbes-aicp/keeping-renters-their-homes-through-collective-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep people in place</a> while enhancing and offering access to new streams of capital investment.</p>
<p>To make it work for those who need it most, cities in collaboration with community leaders must pursue protective investment strategies with intentionality and make available data aggregated by race, income, gender and a full accounting of the social and economic vulnerabilities that exist in a region &ndash; be it related to health, climate change impact, existing environmental vulnerabilities, housing affordability or transportation access and economic opportunity, or all of the above.</p>
<p>Work that is community-driven and -informed and aligned with neighborhood plans helps to guarantee that investment yields the greatest returns.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1578" src="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Opportunity-Zones-%E2%80%93-Neighborhood-Aerial-View.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" srcset="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Opportunity-Zones-&ndash;-Neighborhood-Aerial-View.jpg 675w, https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Opportunity-Zones-&ndash;-Neighborhood-Aerial-View-300x200.jpg 300w" alt="" width="675" height="450" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The White House&rsquo;s executive order creates a new White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council chaired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to prioritize and/or focus Federal investments and programs on urban and economically distressed communities, including qualified opportunity zones.</p>
<p>It directs each agency to assess key actions that can be taken (under existing authorities) to minimize all regulatory and administrative costs and burdens that discourage public and private investment in qualified zones. It encourages the coordination of Federal interagency efforts to help ensure that private and public stakeholders&mdash; such as investors and business owners &mdash; can successfully develop strategies for economic growth and revitalization.</p>
<p>Any Opportunity Zone investment or policy framework should recognize and foster the empowerment of communities that have been historically excluded from decision-making and asset-building.</p>
<p>Communities need People-first Public Private Partnership (P4) Investments in public projects that grant the private sector special incentives that align with community plans, provide greater sustainability and improve the quality of life for residents. People need resources and funding that can advance investment without displacement and preserve their cultural legacy.</p>
<p>Such an approach will lead to more equitable returns and greater community ownership, particularly when projects focus on addressing racial disparities, improving the social determinants of health, and building more energy efficient and climate-resilient communities.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" src="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/equitable-development-checklist.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" srcset="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/equitable-development-checklist.jpg 634w, https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/equitable-development-checklist-300x211.jpg 300w" alt="" width="634" height="445" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Communities of color, rural and low-income neighborhoods want greater investment that preserves and strengthens current residents, business and cultures, offering new ways to build community wealth while lifting up the neighborhoods they love.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that city officials and advocates use the Opportunity Zones designation to demonstrate long-term community benefits, alternative community development models, and performance measures that ensure better outcomes for communities.</p>
