<article>
<p><strong>By Marissa Ramirez (NRDC), Dr. Erica Holloman-Hill (WAWA), Mona Wang (LIIF), and Darryl Haddock (WAWA)</strong></p>
<p>We thrive through our connection to land, to community, and to each other. Parks and public lands offer these important connections between people, communities, and nature, as spaces for community stability, health, and well-being &ndash; something that this pandemic has taught us is more critical than ever. Yet, not everyone in this country has the same access to these spaces, related green investments, and the positive benefits they provide. Our national parks and public lands too often carry the legacy of extraction and exclusion of Black, Indigenous and communities of color.</p>
<p>Despite exclusionary policies and practices, these communities maintained access to their lands &ndash; for access to Mother Nature has never been man&rsquo;s to give. The bubble of whiteness and its privileges has burst, and calls for racial equity must be answered to begin to heal historic injustices and restore connections.</p>
<p>There is momentum for change under the new administration. The Biden plan places racial equity, climate change, and health front and center. Choosing Deb Haaland as Secretary for the Department of Interior fortifies this commitment. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/12/17/deb-haaland-interior-secretary-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haaland&rsquo;s appointment is historic</a>. As the first Native American Cabinet secretary, <a href="https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/blog/deb-haalands-nomination-resonates-native-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she represents tribes</a> who have not only lacked but have been systemically denied the resources, representation, and voice to longstanding environmental injustice. She represents the promise of a new era for this country&rsquo;s connection with its land, one that connects with all people, especially those often excluded. In Biden&rsquo;s first days in office, he has signed several Executive Orders, including those that result in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requiring agency review of racial equity</a>, which hopefully set the precedent for what is to come.</p>
<h3><strong>So what can that new era look like?</strong><strong><em> </em></strong></h3>
<p>Parks and open spaces have never existed separately from communities. The role of the Department of Interior (DOI) includes preserving our nation&rsquo;s cultural and natural heritage spanning both urban and rural settings.</p>
<p>In the US, the legacy of harm and poor land-use decisions at the federal and state levels has several beginnings as it relates to Black, Indigenous and people of color. From the direct removal of Native Americans and Africans from their land to slavery, these decisions were later codified by legislation such as the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/indian-treaties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Removal Act</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/black-codes-and-jim-crow-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Codes</a> (that were enacted in the South and North, following the Civil War and Emancipation). This legacy of the pursuit of ruthless economic growth continues to harm through poor land-use and management.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;faith without works is dead,&rdquo; then so is <em>equitable</em> policy without <em>equitable</em> enforcement. We need policies (and the enforcement of such policies) that ensure that people &ndash; particularly Black, Indigenous and people of color &ndash; not only have access to public land, but are positioned to provide stewardship, cultural inclusion, and guidance for those lands ensuring they remain healthy and climate neutral. Creating sustainable, holistic communities requires parks and public lands that can be used in varied and unique ways that cater to the needs of the people they serve.</p>
<p>The Parks, Open, and Urban Space Equity group (as part of the <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/">SPARCC Collaborative</a>) came together as a collective voice to call for a more inclusive <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pathways-Parks.pdf">parks and open space agenda</a> that protects the interests of diverse communities, while preventing green gentrification and displacement. Our policy and goals are part of implementing our larger SPARCC platform: <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pathways-to-Communtiy-Prosperity.pdf">Pathways to Community Prosperity</a> We believe in self-determination and stewardship of land while advancing deep engagement and personal agency for designing and implementing parks and green investments. Our three core priorities include advancing: 1) community-led parks design, development, and implementation, 2) equitable parks systems (including the infrastructure to support it), and 3) green investments for resilient neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by and fully support several of the Biden Administration priorities that align with ours, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Investing $1.7 trillion in climate and environmental justice and conserving 30 percent of U.S. lands, oceans and inland waters (&ldquo;30&times;30&rdquo;) over the next 10 years.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Creating a Civilian Climate Corps</li>
<li aria-level="1">Advancing racial equity across the economy</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these and other goals, strong, meaningful connections must be forged with state and local communities to address and quell long-standing inequities. The following are the principles and commitments that we, as the Parks, Open, and Urban Space Equity group, believe the administration must uphold, embody, and commit to action:</p>
<h3><strong>Invest equitably in local parks and our communities</strong></h3>
<p>The new administration must continue to build bridges across Black, Indigenous and communities of color in connection to the land to create places that are healthy, climate resilient, and put people and communities first. One of the top priorities in advancing climate and environmental justice should be the implementation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Permanently authorized by Congress as part of a historic public lands package in 2019, the program provides funds for conservation of public lands and water. In July of 2020, the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/sharon-buccino/good-news-congress-passes-great-american-outdoors-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great American Outdoors Act</a> received bipartisan support for guaranteed funding for LWCF, thanks to the support of Rep. Haaland, Sen. Tom Udall, Sen. Michael Bennet, and others.</p>
<p>In addition to funding national parks and forests, LWCF provides critical state grants for parks, open space acquisition, and development in communities. However, DOI drastically underspent LWCF as stipulated by Congress. To fulfill this requirement and to support communities, the administration must engage local organizations and networks including those our group represents, to ensure funds reach the right groups and to identify eligible projects and to deploy the funds. DOI should deploy funds in ways that allow for equitable access to parks and open space as well as the contracts to design and build those parks and open spaces as anchors, not drivers of displacement or gentrification. Once established, these natural spaces should support the creation and implementation of community-led programming that reconnects us back to Mother Nature.</p>
<p>Often, federal investments favor organizations that have received funding in the past &ndash; limiting the reach and ultimately the impact on communities that would benefit most. Budgetary resources toward programs like the National Park Service&rsquo;s Community Assistance Program should be dedicated to partnering with communities, including urban areas. In Atlanta, the <a href="http://wawa-online.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">West Atlanta Watershed Alliance&rsquo;s</a> (WAWA) programs, such as O-Academy (a K-8th grade culturally relevant environmental science camp) or the Great American Campout and Urban Forest Festival (an annual family event) developed out of deep trust built in the community. These and other excellent community programs would thrive with this kind of government funding.</p>

<h3><strong>Build a climate resilient future through creating jobs that are family-sustaining </strong></h3>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s plan includes creating a Civilian Climate Corps for &ldquo;mobilizing the next generation of conservation and resilience workers.&rdquo; This idea could enrich the lives of many people and communities while enabling a range of climate change improvements from infrastructure improvements to ecosystem health. However, this fails to adequately hold space for the mobilization of the next generation of Black, Indigenous and people of color conservation and resilience scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs. Young people from Black and Indigenous communities want to be included in conservation work and have much to offer in this space. We must leverage existing assets in communities, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and indigenous and tribal colleges. The program must be accessible, particularly in accommodating participants that have assumed caretaker responsibilities by offering childcare or supplemental financial support. Finally, allocating funding to ensure training in conservation provides for all related expenses to their participation ensures that youth participants in Black, Indigenous and communities of color historically excluded can be part of this effort.</p>
<h3><strong>Address barriers for deliberately overlooked populations in our park systems</strong></h3>
<p>Addressing the behaviors that support systemic inequity in park systems is not an easy or short-term task. The implementation and enforcement of policies that support systemic equity in park systems is also difficult but equally necessary. Ensuring community-driven parks design and implementation in addition to diversity and representation throughout the workforce will require honest and ongoing conversation. Policies must not simply be race neutral, but must be race forward. A few key recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Implement participatory budgeting to ensure that community voices are represented, engaged, and influential in decisions for parks design and implementation &ndash; including hiring, procurement, and vending in historically excluded communities</li>
<li aria-level="1">Establish interagency partnerships to address climate and health equity and advance equitable access to green space and nature in underserved communities by working closely with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Department of Labor (DOL), and Department of Transportation (DOT).</li>
<li aria-level="1">Use data to measure the benefits and potential harms of programmatic investments. Existing sources such as Data for Black Lives, United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Office of Minority Health (DHHS) can provide necessary demographic health and equity data. In addition, expand the use of the EPA Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool (EJSCREEN) to ensure most vulnerable communities are receiving benefits.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Revisit and amplify the Urban Agenda to identify further opportunities for climate resilience as 87 percent of flood impacts are in communities of color along with related green gentrification. There is an opportunity to adapt vacant and underutilized spaces for climate and cultural projects on public lands that can leverage other federal investments for local capacity and educational opportunities in urban underserved areas.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Ensure that public spaces have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=664444371163007&amp;ref=watch_permalink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visible land acknowledgements</a> and written history of oppressed communities&rsquo; contributions to the land.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>There is Opportunity</strong></h3>
<p>To most, parks and public lands may seem like places for recreation and respite &ndash; but they are so much more than that. Parks and public lands are a place for us to come together to connect with the natural world and to our community. They are a place for cultural celebration of who we are, our history, our heritage, and our cultural identities. Protecting these precious spaces and ensuring that all people have access to them is not just an investment in our environment, it is an investment in our collective health and well-being as a community.</p>

<p>There is a frustrating truth in the world of community development: new large-scale development, no matter how much it is designed to support the existing neighborhood, often displaces or alienates some longtime residents. Whether it&rsquo;s a transit project, housing project or large-scale park project, the outcomes are typically the same. Assets in our communities that offer us increased connectivity, shelter, and planned outdoor spaces can act as triggers that escalate land values which usually price out existing residents, often low-income and people of color, and more often renters.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/07/gentrification-effects-neighborhood-data-economic-statistics/594064/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">CityLab article</a> showed that 30 percent of existing renters stay after a neighborhood gentrifies &ndash; but what happens to the other 70 percent of renters?</p>
<p>The 70 percent wasn&rsquo;t planned for. Our planning processes and practices are founded on structural and institutional inequities, so our outcomes are in turn unequal and leave people behind.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that these same foundational inequities impact the way we develop parks and urban green spaces. Given the lack of centering equity and spatial justice in these practices, communities&rsquo; experiences of developing much needed green space are the same. This was the case for the <a href="https://chi.streetsblog.org/2018/12/07/study-the-606-shows-the-downside-of-having-parks-nonprofits-lead-infra-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">606 trail</a> in Chicago, for example, which saw a <a href="https://www.housingstudies.org/releases/measuring-impact-606/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">48. 2 percent</a> increase in housing prices along the west side of the trail. Increased trail access and the increase in property value offers community benefits, yes, but it&rsquo;s not shared equally. Most financial benefits are actually reaped by more educated or higher income owners, who may see an increase in both home values and income according to this <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/07/gentrification-effects-neighborhood-data-economic-statistics/594064/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia paper.</a></p>
<p>But truly, all is not lost. Communities continue to push back and develop models for creating green space that does not come at the cost of community stability, and instead contributes to the health, well-being, and inclusivity of residents. One such example is the <a href="https://bbardc.org/equity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">11</a><sup><a href="https://bbardc.org/equity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">th</a></sup><a href="https://bbardc.org/equity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"> Street Bridge Park</a> in Washington, D.C. The crux of the project is focusing its work on workforce development, housing, small business and wealth building, and social equity. Since the vision began, 71 full time jobs have been created in historically lower income Wards 7 and 8, more than 2,500 residents have become engaged in tenants&rsquo; rights initiatives, cultural works such as the Black Love Experience featuring music and art have been supported, and more than 7,500 pounds of fresh produce have been harvested through community-driven strategies. And one lesson that the 11<sup>th</sup> Street Bridge Park has for others is to <strong><a href="https://vimeo.com/334716089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">start the work of equitable development early</a></strong>, countering the practice to build the infrastructure and then deal with the consequences.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;We need to flip the sequence of events &ndash; create community driven equity strategies, implement those strategies and only then create the asset (park, infrastructure, etc.). In the Bridge Park&rsquo;s case, by the time the park is expected to open in 2023, we&rsquo;ll have implemented our equitable development strategies for 7 years.&rdquo;</p>
<cite>-Scott Kratz, Director, 11th Street Bridge Park, Washington, DC</cite></blockquote>
<p>This model illustrates that green spaces can be a positive anchor for community and equitable community development, while ensuring that their wide range of social, economic, environmental, health, and cultural benefits can be captured by all members of a community. Benefits that range from free spaces for arts, to healthier air, and to improved <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5663018/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">psychological wellbeing</a>. By centering green space development on racial equity and spatial justice, it also ensures that these spaces don&rsquo;t drive up the cost of living so much that residents are displaced from their homes and unable to benefit from the improvements.</p>
<p>The Strong Prosperous and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC) collaboratives in Atlanta, Chicago, Memphis and Los Angeles are focusing on ways to influence the equitable development of parks and open spaces and ensure that planners are considering housing, community preservation, economic opportunities, culture, ownership, and racial equity as part of a holistic strategy.</p>
<p>The SPARCC collaboratives have seen successes, such as the development of the first <a href="http://rposd.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Revised-Displacement-Avoidance-Strategy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">anti-displacement policy</a> in the Los Angeles County Regional Park and Open Space Park District. Additionally, based on their own advocacy around parks and urban open spaces, the table partners have shared their own best practices and knowledge for advancing park and urban open space equity.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">1<strong>Start with your values</strong> <strong>and needs:</strong> Center your project around the community&rsquo;s vision and values by organizing around what is most important. Harness existing community assets and respect the lived experiences of current residents. Ask key questions such as &ldquo;What is most valuable to the community? What benefits and burdens are created (economic, environmental, health) because of the new space? How does the project advance racial justice, self-determination, and inclusion? How will affordability of the neighborhood be maintained? How will local culture be respected and honored?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><em>Spotlight</em></strong><em>: While not a SPARCC site, the principles developed by the Seattle Office of Sustainability and the Environment, offer a good example of starting with shared values: <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OSE/Equity/EEI-POP-COC-Dec182017-screenlayout.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Principles of Public Space for Communities of Color.</a> Additionally, our friends at the 11th Street Bridge Park developed a <a href="https://vimeo.com/346942267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="7-step process (opens in a new tab)">7-step process</a> for working with residents to create an equity plan.</em></p>
<p class="has-drop-cap">2<strong>Maintain Project Control in the Community:</strong> Projects can lose their original intent depending on the person or group managing the work. Focus on maintaining community control over the ideas and strategies to maximize the benefits the community can receive, in addition to the environmental and health value being offered. Set shared definitions of zoning overlays, affordable housing goals, and project geographies and put safeguards in place to keep people accountable to those definitions and goals. Deep collaboration is needed early and often with the group leading the work, especially if local government is involved. When deep collaboration exists, groups become less reactive to displacement and lack of housing affordability because equity would ideally be embedded through the process.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight:</strong> <em>In Chicago, the 606 trail started out as a community-driven project and it quickly left the hands of the community. Advocates stated that there was an inability and a lack of structure for collaborating with the government and conservation groups, which meant less ability to elevate deep concerns and mitigate social, cultural, and physical displacement. Members of the <a href="http://www.elevatedchicago.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Elevated Chicago</a> collaborative are now pursuing strategies that increase affordable homeownership opportunities for low to moderate income legacy families and addressing the cultural and economic shifts in the neighborhood.</em></p>
<p class="has-drop-cap"><strong>Work with Local Elected Officials</strong>: Local elected officials can either be powerful advocates or unintentional roadblocks. Advocates should ensure that elected officials understand the issues in parks and open space projects in order to properly voice support and concerns. Develop a plan to cultivate relationships with elected officials who can champion the issues and elevate the benefits of equitable parks development. Incorporate time for developing educational materials for the community and elected officials and engage in participatory budgeting processes.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight</strong>: <em>The LA River Restoration project was originally championed in the 1980s by environmental and conservation groups. At the time, the groups weren&rsquo;t thinking of nor were they able to manage housing issues. Despite being foreseeable, the scale and scope of the crisis grew, ultimately resulting in gentrification and displacement leading to homelessness for some in the community. The work of local advocates, like the <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Pathway-to-Parks-and-Affordable-Housing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Los Angeles Regional Open Space and Affordable Housing</a> (LA ROSAH) collaborative, with elected officials, city, and county partners turned into the first anti-displacement policy in the parks department.</em></p>
<p class="has-drop-cap">4<strong>Integrate Arts and Culture Strategies</strong>: Arts and culture activities bring people together around the ideals that a community values most. Developing an arts and culture strategy provides an opportunity for relationship-building and affirms existing people and cultures by preserving and promoting cultural elements that can be integrated into parks and open space projects. Arts and culture also deepen community engagement and provide a platform for working creatively to address community concerns like greater local economic ownership, healthy food access, and displacement.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight:</strong> <em>In the Heights neighborhood in North Memphis, the Heights CDC is activating three parcels of land that will house a portion of a future trail line called <a href="https://www.heightsline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">the HeightsLine</a>. One portion of the space offers a place for the community to gather around arts and culture activities and engage in the design of what the space and trail line can become. The strategies also encourage residents to envision opportunities for economic development along the line given existing disinvestment in the community.</em></p>
<p class="has-drop-cap">5<strong>Buy the Land: </strong>Be prepared for early land acquisition and land banking around a project. Put a plan in motion for appropriately and equitably gaining parcels of land and build in the time to work with the community to yield the kind of outcomes desired. Land is the most volatile element in redevelopment projects because low-income people, renters, elderly, disabled and people of color are most vulnerable to escalating land prices. When acquiring land, think about these items: who will hold the land, who will pay for the taxes, what is the plan for parcel distribution, how will affordable housing be financed, and what is the structure of community ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Spotlight:</strong> <em>In Atlanta, many residents who lived along the BeltLine were renters and neither owned the land nor their homes. And for the lower and middle income residents who did own their homes, they had to deal with a rise in property taxes. This was a big challenge to be addressed through increased affordable housing and community ownership goals. Through the work of </em><a href="https://atltransformationalliance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)"><em>TransFormation Alliance</em></a><em> and other partners at the land bank and local land trusts, strategies are being developed to acquire parcels around the BeltLine and create investments that support the surrounding neighborhoods.</em></p>
<p>By focusing on equitable development of parks and urban open spaces we focus on people&rsquo;s right to live in and have access to safer and less polluted environments, ensure that environmental projects provide the intended benefits for communities of color, and help provide natural and safe respites for families and cultural activities. Such an approach takes into account the daily struggles of low-income and people of color, some of whom experience open space, not as freeing and restorative, but as potentially threatening and unsafe.</p>
<p>The positive aspects of parks and open space can only be created if their development is just, equitable, and inclusive in both process and outcome &ndash; so that people can stay in place if they so choose. And finally, maybe, we can end our frustration over the needlessly inequitable community development cycle.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">You can tell a lot about a community by the state of its parks. No parks? That says something. Neglected or dangerous parks? A clue that residents are struggling to raise healthy families.</span></p>
</header>
<article>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">We tend to think that the state of the neighborhood dictates the state of its parks. But what if the reverse were true? What if improving parks could, in turn, lift up the community&ndash; and without displacing families?</p>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">The participants in SPARCC&rsquo;s first Virtual Learning Conversation&ndash; Equitable Development of Parks and Urban Open Space&ndash; came from all sides of the issue, including community activists, regional planners, parks officials, and environmental and social justice advocates. They answered a call to &ldquo;break out of our silos&rdquo; to talk about the linkages between racial justice, parks, and urban space, as host Odetta MacLeish-White of Atlanta&rsquo;s TransFormation Alliance, put it.</p>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Keynoter Dr. Hanaa Hamdi, a national health and social impact investment strategist, gave a stark example&ndash; that of Mildred Helms Park in Newark, N.J., which became a catalyst for improved health and economic opportunity when invested stakeholders came together in a neglected neighborhood.</p>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">As Hamdi noted, parks offer much more than recreation, with studies showing that green, open spaces used well can decrease crime and violence, serve as opportunities to create jobs and businesses, improve social interactions and have profound effects on individual and community health, combating obesity and social isolation, and helping in healthy child development.</p>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Hamdi noted that among the benefits of an urban farm at Mildred Helms Park were the creation of local jobs and the production of healthy produce for local preschoolers.</p>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">&ldquo;If a small park is able to spur economic development for a small community, imagine what large parks can do,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">Of course, with beautiful parks comes the potential for &ldquo;green gentrification&rdquo; and displacement of long-time residents. But, as the Virtual Learning Conversation showed, a key to combating that outcome is to focus on people and community needs.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
<p>&ldquo;If you plan parks for people, then the history of people should also be prioritized. In planning and parks, that history hasn&rsquo;t been good for people of color.&rdquo;</p>
<cite>Dr. Hanaa Hamdi</cite></blockquote>
<p class="has-text-color has-very-dark-gray-color">VLC participants saw concrete examples of success by the Los Angeles Regional Open Space and Affordable Housing (LA ROSAH) collaborative in combating green gentrification in Chinatown and Northeast Los Angeles, where some of the city&rsquo;s poorest residents live and where homelessness is at crisis levels. Through an assessment process, and with funding related to public investment along the LA River, the city is beginning to think about parks in a different way and inequities are being addressed.</p>

<cite><em>This quote, and all others in this article, from Dr. Hanaa Hamdi.</em></cite></blockquote>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>Stephanie Gidigbi</strong>: We got so much good feedback after hearing your keynote at the Virtual Learning Conversation event and want to dig down into your work.</p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>Hanaa Hamdi</strong>: Thank you. It was a great opportunity to speak and learn about the work coming out of the various SPARCC cities. What&rsquo;s particularly exciting to see how these communities are actively working to plan and develop whole and healthy communities inclusive of parks and other green public spaces. This past May, I had the honor to join <a href="https://www.newjerseycommunitycapital.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Jersey Community Capital</a> (NJCC) as director of Health Impact Investment Strategies and Partnerships. As a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and with an arm in community preservation, NJCC has a very long and rooted history in sustainable community development and neighborhood revitalization. My role adds to this tradition, as we are now more focused and intentional about building healthy, inclusive and equitable neighborhoods. This means we are focused on people, places, polices and partnerships that support holistic and comprehensive approach to investing in all assets of strong and healthy neighborhoods&mdash;such as safe and stable homes, high-quality early childhood education, vibrant main streets with small business opportunities and community spaces that engage and invite all people. More specifically, my role is to develop and implement strategies that advance health equity in all aspects of our work. We are well aware that we can&rsquo;t do this alone, we need to partner with, private-public and cross-sector collaborators that share our mission and vision of healthy communities. To that end, my team and I work to cultivate partnerships with health and non-health organizations who have interest in building healthy communities. Given that 80% of our health is determined by environments outside of health care, such as places we live, work, learn and play&mdash;it is safe to say that everyone and every sector has (should) interest in health and healthy communities. <strong>There is a strong economic rationale for investing in health</strong>. Health boosts individual and household income, as well as a country&rsquo;s GDP, in so many different ways. For example, healthier people work harder and take fewer days off for sickness, and healthier, well-nourished children are more likely to go to school and stay there longer, which in turn is linked to higher earnings in adulthood.</p>
<p class="has-text-color">For me, this means we frame health more broadly to identify others who share our value in health. For example, we are working with early childhood education sector, food industry, and other financial institutions that appreciate the connection between the social, environmental and economic determinants and health outcomes. Additionally, we are building strong working relationships with many health care institutions and hospital systems. In New Jersey, we are currently working with several hospitals, RWJ Barnabas Hospital System, St. Joseph University Medical Center, Trinitas Medical Center, AtlantiCare and many are investing to build healthy communities by focusing on housing (i.e. supportive housing, subsidized and supportive housing for the most financially vulnerable patients; healthy homes; and employee home ownership down payment assistance) and improving neighborhood by investing in urban farms, early education centers and schools, and parks and open space for their patients, employees and the community at large. Across the country we are collaborating with national health systems such as Dignity Health and Catholic Health Initiatives, who are investing in our community loan fund to support home ownership and small business development programs</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>SG</strong>: As you talk about the layering and the connections to the opportunities that really support more transformative plans for communities, I was hoping you could talk about your role working in government as the Director of Health and Human Services for the city of Newark and how you really leveraged that role and your connection through grass roots organizing, which were some of the things that you really focused on during our conversation when you were with us for the Virtual Learning Convening.</p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>HH</strong>: Of course. I&rsquo;m going to take a step back and provide a bit of information about my background before my role as the health director for the city of Newark. I moved to Newark in 2005 for a graduate work in a joint doctoral program in public health, and architecture and urban planning. My doctoral dissertation focused on the impact of built environments (food systems, housing, open space, and active transportation) and how people make health behavior decisions based on the design of cities and social structural drivers. After graduate school, I decided to stay in Newark and joined Rutgers Medical School as Assistant Professor in Dept. of Family Medicine. While at the medical school, my research continued to expand investigating the intersection of the built environment and social structures how that intersection shapes health decisions. It is not common to see community development and urban planning oriented research or teaching in medical schools. But I had incredible support and mentorship at the medical school, and my chair supported my research, community development projects and grass root organizing. For example, I received my first research grant from NJ Dept of Health-Shaping NJ to investigate the impact of community violence on health behavior of families with children (Safety by Design). We found, as in many urban cities, in Newark, particularly in the South Ward were I focused my research, blighted neighborhoods, the lack of affordable and safe housing, community-level violence, household and community level food insecurity, and entrenched intergenerational poverty were at the core of the social, physical and mental health issues. But in spite of all of these conditions, Newark residents had grit and were determined reclaim their neighborhoods and improve living conditions for all.</p>
<p class="has-text-color">Through the Shaping NJ grant, we were able to hire and train Newark residents in research methods to work along medical students to scan community health needs and identify community prioritized solutions. The residents learned valuable skills that enabled them to gain employment and with meaningful wages. The medical students had an opportunity to walk and see the community and neighborhood conditions that influenced the health of Newark residents. These students also had the opportunity to observe the social and environmental factors that determined the health of the patients that came to our clinics and emergency rooms. This research helped secure more grants from Living Cities and Community Foundation of NJ, and this allowed community residents and medical students to co-develop an intervention plan: The Healthy Village&mdash;which included redevelopment and programming of Mildred Helms Park, housing preservation of abandoned and foreclosed homes around the Park, improving neighborhood corner stores, training community residents to become certified farmers and also business operators of the urban farm&ndash;which fed 70-preschools in Newark and provided fresh vegetables to high-end restaurants in New York). In 2014, a year after I received the grant, I was appointed to become the director of health and human services for City of Newark. Five years later The Healthy Village still continues, NJCC acquired the abandoned homes around Mildred Helms Park and continues to renovate and redevelop the home with the generous support of RWJ-Barnabas and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The Farm is currently co-operated by Essex County and Radical Farms. As the health director of health and human services, I oversaw complex public health emergencies and some that were global epidemics. Few months after I took office, we faced the 2014 Ebola Virus epidemic, shortly after there was a fatal case of Lassa Fever Virus and not too long after that in 2015 we had 17,000 children exposed to lead. As a public health practitioner, I had training to manage communicable disease at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However nothing could have prepared me for a global epidemic in a city with aging water and sewer infrastructure, and while simultaneously addressing a growing homeless population.</p>

<p class="has-text-color"><strong>SG: As we talk about your role in joining the city, it didn&rsquo;t start with just joining the city, it really started with the research that you had been doing and working with medical students to address the social determinants of health. That included active transportation, parks, housing and also aging infrastructure. You actually went to residents, engaged them early on, did asset assessments that allowed you to map the needs and resources in those respective neighborhoods. When you were presented the opportunity to work for the city, it was really developing out that program in tandem with city resources to support a lot of those initiatives. Is that correct?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>HH</strong>: Absolutely. The work I delivered as the health director was informed by nine years of community engagement, facilitated discussions, in addition to my academic research..</p>
<p class="has-text-color">In 2010, I launched a Newark-wide, program called CommunityTalks. Each program convened local experts in health and medicine, social sciences, complementary medicine&mdash;such as acupuncture, meditation, herbalists, santeras, drummers&mdash;in a facilitated discussions on health and wellness topics that reflected the culture and health concerns prioritized by the community. By the end of 2013, we facilitated 30 sessions on topics from diabetes management to evictions, childhood hunger, domestic violence and police brutality. Out of these sessions, I was able to develop intervention and preventive policies, programs and ordinances in city hall. It all came from Newark residents. I have always followed the Five-Ps to equity framework or approach in any community health initiatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with <strong>people&rsquo;s</strong> needs, priorities and their history and ensure they have an active voice and say in how the initiative is developed and implemented.</li>
<li>Use thorough assessments of <strong>place </strong>(at the neighborhood) where you intend to implement the initiative. Document needs as well as assets. Capitalize on the rich history of what makes communities culturally resilient,</li>
<li>Foster and cultivate cross-sector <strong>partnerships</strong> to support your initiative. No one person, organization or field can carry out community initiatives or development alone;</li>
<li>Establish <strong>policies </strong>that ameliorate sustainability and the impact of the initiative.</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>SG: I love that. One of the other questions that came up was just how do we restore parks and preserve the history of a community? Are there other things that you see as guiding and really thinking about how we can restore parks, preserve the history of a community?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>HH</strong>: The the other <strong>P</strong> [chuckle] and that&rsquo;s community development <strong>planning</strong>. We build parks for people but oftentimes the residents are not engaged. Every green conference and meetings I attend, I am asked about green gentrification- which asserts that new parks and other green public space development gentrify neighborhoods (i.e. any one or a combination of any one of these&ndash;increased property tax residential and business, increase rent and decrease in affordable housing) displace low-income black and brown communities. Few take away points: First, every community has a right to have access to quality parks within walking distance from where they live, work, learn and worship. Parks are essential features of healthy communities and when planned and designed with intentionality and community residents, they can powerfully impact urgent public, social and environmental issues. Second, parks don&rsquo;t displace people, people displace people. Historically, community development such as highway systems and transportation, housing development policies&mdash;urban renewal&ndash; explicitly targeted black communities and have had devastating lasting impact. Today, park development can potentially have the same negative impact. When park development, like any development, is not intentional and inclusive of all the people community in every aspect of the development, these green spaces by design can exclude people, especially vulnerable populations (i.e. homeless population, people and children with disability). Even worse, they can be potential catalysts for displacement. Park building is part of larger community development plan that include housing, transportation or businesses. Park development practices only involve the community in the participatory design phase&mdash;often time this is conflated with community engagement, but it&rsquo;s totally different&mdash;at this stage, site development has been confirmed and the community is invited to choose the aesthetics and color themes for the park. Secondly, park development agencies rarely conduct comprehensive community needs assessment to understand the community&rsquo;s vulnerability&mdash;eviction rate, homelessness, private redevelopment plans&ndash; before redeveloping existing parks or creating new green spaces.</p>
<p class="has-text-color">Without this full understanding, park developers further exacerbate community vulnerability and can spur gentrification and which eventually lead to displacement. From Central Park in New York City to 606 highline in Chicago, these parks were not planned or developed with or for black and brown communities. As result, many families and communities were uprooted and histories were lost.</p>
<p class="has-text-color">When planned with intentionality and in tandem with the community, parks can help address the most urgent climate, social and health issues. For example the Mildred Helms Park Resurrection Committee in Newark, centered park development with neighborhood revitalization plan (e.g. affordable housing, small business development and economic stability, early childhood education, community health center&hellip;). After developing the plan, the Committee worked with a local park organization to redevelop the park.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When park development, like any development, is not intentional and inclusive of all the people community in every aspect of the development, these green spaces by design can exclude people, especially vulnerable populations.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="has-text-color"><strong>SG: A follow-up conversation was, &ldquo;Well, what about open space?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>HH</strong>: Every community has connection to open space, every community has a need for nature. Parks and open public spaces can restore frayed social fabrics lost to trauma and community violence. Well planned open spaces informed and guided by people&rsquo;s history and culture have a huge potential bring people and communities together to heal. Open spaces can be restorative, we just have to think of them differently.</p>
<p class="has-text-color">What was really helpful in the redevelopment of Mildred Helms Park was the reorientation of how the residents thought of the park and its function. This shift from thinking of a park as only a site for recreation to also realizing its full and broader utility to help improve the quality of the neighborhood, address unemployment, curb community level violence and increase community connection. Although not a large park, from 2006 to now, the Mildred Helms Park employees adult and young adults year round. In a city where rampant violence among youths out numbers youth summer programs, the park keeps many youth employed and engaged in positive activities.</p>

<p class="has-text-color"><strong>SG: Another thing we&rsquo;ve been talking about within SPARCC is that we&rsquo;ve seen the real estate market respond to new amenities in a community, creating green gentrification. Can you comment on the interplay, particularly when you talk about the utility function of parks, between the real estate and capital markets and the factors that you&rsquo;re mentioning in terms of planning and park investment?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>HH</strong>: The phenomenon of green gentrification is an interplay of development and practices of poor park planning, More often than not parks are planned <strong><em>for</em></strong> rather than <strong><em>with</em></strong> communities of color, and in my experience, this has always led to displacing communities.</p>
<p class="has-text-color">There are several actions communities can take to use parks to build stronger communities and stand against capital markets and real estate do not value indigenous communities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish city charters that protect communities from <a href="http://www.turnerlegalpllc.com/blog/2016/9/13/what-is-parkland-alienation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">park alienation</a> and private redevelopment of public lands. Santa Barbara, CA and New York City have established municipal ordinances and these can serve as guide and best practices.</li>
<li>Every community should be familiar with its green space masterplan. Work with local government and city planner to establish public hearing for every park development.</li>
<li>Establish <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/articles/community-land-trusts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">community land trusts</a> that protect and preserve public lands for affordable housing and open space.</li>
<li>Every new park development should be required to establish displacement protection policies for financially vulnerable population impacted by the new/redevelopment of the park. This should be especially required of national green organizations that develop neighborhood parks but abandoned the projects after completing the development. These organizations should establish and fund local community park stewardship groups to maintain and program the parks.</li>
<li>Work with local anchor institutions (nonprofit academic and higher education, hospital and health care systems, community development corporations and banks) to invest in park development. These investments meet institutional tax-exemption requirements, and by definition these institutions are anchored in the community and have interest in stabilizing and improving the quality of life of the residents.</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>SG: Solving the challenges is not just about the park, it&rsquo;s the intersectionality of all the issues facing a community, is that right?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>HH</strong>: Absolutely. It is not an accident that where there is a need for a park, there are also other needs, such as affordable quality housing, environmental justice, food security, employment, and access to quality health care. It is also not a coincidence these same communities disproportionately suffer from clusters of chronic diseases, maternal and infant mortality and shorter life expectancy by as much as 15 and 20 years when compared to more affluent communities. A park alone cannot displace an intact community, and just as much, one park cannot resolve all the social and health issues of a community. However, parks should be part of a larger community strategy to help address social, environmental and climate, and health issues.</p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>SG: Thank you for your time in speaking with us, and also in terms of all that you have done.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-color"><strong>HH</strong>: Thank you, this is an amazing opportunity to actually be able to talk about how to conceptualize community development and incorporate park development into neighborhood planning and revitalization efforts. I am excited to see the evolution of the SPARCC cities&rsquo; interest in park development as a strategy to build resilient healthy communities.</p>
