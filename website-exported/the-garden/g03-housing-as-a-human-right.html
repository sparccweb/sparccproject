<h1>Property or People? The Enduring Legacies of Racially Discriminatory Housing Policies</h1>


<article>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard to argue that housing is not a fundamental human need. Decent, affordable housing should be a basic right for everybody in this country. The reason is simple: without stable shelter, everything else falls apart.&rdquo;<br>â€• <strong>Matthew Desmond, </strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/45720714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1964, Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned the words to the timeless ballad &ldquo;A House is Not A Home&rdquo; which has been sung by greats including Dionne Warwick and Luther Vandross. The lyrics go &ldquo;&hellip;a house is not a home when there&rsquo;s no one there&hellip;&rdquo; Though written as a love ballad, the song could speak to the housing crisis we&rsquo;re facing in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no one there,&rdquo; as families are displaced in staggering numbers.</p>
<p>The issues surrounding the looming housing crisis, the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/11/unemployment-rose-higher-in-three-months-of-covid-19-than-it-did-in-two-years-of-the-great-recession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sudden spikes</a> in unemployment, and the loss of healthcare, among other things, are not a sudden &lsquo;unprecedented&rsquo; conundrum caused by the pandemic. These issues have been a priority for many across this nation. Low-income families, renters, and affordable housing occupants alike feel increased pressure to make ends meet. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/3/21203006/cares-act-direct-payments-unemployment-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bureaucratic response</a> has been <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/chart-book-federal-housing-spending-is-poorly-matched-to-need" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lackluster</a> and the day-to-day stresses persist.</p>
<p>In an August 2020 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/well-protect-americas-suburbs-11597608133?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a> article, President Donald Trump and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson attempted to push their narrative of boogeymen invading the plush American suburbs through low-income housing, bringing crime and chaos with them. This subterfuge by the President aims to pit communities against each other, deflecting from the administration&rsquo;s inability to handle the eviction crisis the nation is currently facing.</p>
<p>From downtown to the suburbs and all points in between, families face rising debt and housing insecurity. The latest data reveals harrowing realities, an estimated 30-40 million people are in danger of eviction. Additionally, people of color are twice as likely to be renters than homeowners, but constitute a disproportionate 80 percent of <a href="https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/10950.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eviction cases</a>. The brunt of this crisis, like nearly every other crisis we face, is being borne by Black and Latinx communities.</p>
<p>Right now, there is an urgent need for rent relief and relief for affordable housing owners. With the unemployment rate currently at 11 percent nationally, and a <a href="https://oui.doleta.gov/press/2020/080620.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projected</a> 1.2 million people being added to those numbers, we are beyond crisis levels. For states and territories like Nevada (24.9 percent), Puerto Rico (23.5 percent), Hawaii (21 percent), California (18.1 percent), Louisiana (16.3 percent), and Georgia (14.5 percent) the numbers are even scarier. Expanding the CARES Act should be a given, but further <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaharziv/2020/08/13/confirmed-extra-400-unemployment-benefit-extension-next-stimulus-package-slashed-to-300/#3e02f8b95f51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">restrictions</a> have hindered the effectiveness of new unemployment benefits putting both renters and owners in jeopardy.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the massive chasm that exists between Black and Latinx communities and white America. Decades of unequal and discriminatory housing policies have left certain neighborhoods lacking basic necessities in their own spaces. Neighborhoods that are poorer and have more residents of color can be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit hotter in the summer</a> than wealthier, whiter parts of the same city. Some must travel across their own city to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/07/how-nature-deprived-neighborhoods-impact-health-people-of-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enjoy basic amenities like shady trees</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/480602-black-communities-face-dangerous-clean-water-and-environmental" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clean drinking water</a>. And it is critical to remember that COVID-19 isn&rsquo;t the only crisis exposing these disproportionalities: the raging fires and unending smoke on the West Coast <a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2020/08/20/wildfire-smoke-poses-greatest-risk-to-low-income-residents-people-of-color-experts-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">harms communities of color</a> more than white communities.</p>
<p>Yet this moment in time presents us with an opportunity to right the wrongs that remain baked into the fabric of this country. There are ways to turn houses back into homes, but it starts with a significant investment in people &ndash; specifically the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
<p>We must proactively bolster communities of color and allow for true independence through equitable investments, including programs that promote greater collective and individual home ownership in these communities, in addition to <a href="https://resourcegeneration.org/land-reparations-indigenous-solidarity-action-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">land-based reparations</a> and <a href="https://centerforneweconomics.org/publications/proposal-for-a-black-commons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Commons</a> to build wealth. Implementing a basic safety net would create peace of mind for many renters and affordable housing owners &ndash; but our city and federal governments must go beyond that to increase paths to home ownership in these communities. Forced segregation through redlining, blockbusting, and discriminatory policies have systemically blocked Black and Latinx communities from homeownership, so it is imperative to dismantle these archaic practices and begin the process of reinvigorating these communities. This includes true implementation of the 1968 Fair Housing Act by reinstituting the <a href="https://www.allianceforhousingjustice.org/post/understanding-affh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing</a> rule.</p>
<p>With the pandemic yet to be contained, there&rsquo;s a very urgent need for financial support for renters and small landlords who <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/black-and-hispanic-landlords-are-facing-great-financial-struggles-because-covid-19-pandemic-they-also-support-their-tenants-higher-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own over half</a> of the affordable rental units nationally. Federally, the Center for Disease Control and the US Department of Health and Human Services issued a <a href="https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/blog/09/20/cdc-issues-nationwide-temporary-eviction-moratorium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">national moratorium on evictions</a>. Unfortunately, the moratorium does not prevent rent from accumulating, places <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/trump-administration-issues-cdc-eviction-moratorium-guidance-benefit-landlords-over?utm_source=NLIHC+All+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=3f16aead8d-memo_101320&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e090383b5e-3f16aead8d-293298901&amp;ct=t(memo_101320)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">onerous requirements on tenants</a>, does not prevent landlords from charging late fees, and allows landlords to begin eviction proceedings before the moratorium expires on January 1, 2021. By the end of the year, renters could owe up to <a href="https://nhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Coalition-letter-FINAL-8-21-20-003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$70 billion in </a>back rent. An emergency rent relief package is essential to dealing with these financial struggles. Local governments can act now by extending rent moratoriums and providing protections against evictions filings wrongfully occurring during the moratorium periods. At the community level, we can also examine the often <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-settles-suit-over-selective-enforcement-cranston-sign-ordinance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biased proceedings</a> of various Homeowners Associations (HOA&rsquo;s) and how they choose to enforce certain rules and mitigate fines by allowing renters to be integrated into HOA systems so their needs can be addressed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/08/10/488313/expanding-supply-affordable-housing-low-wage-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expansion of affordable housing for low-wage workers</a> through public-private partnerships can help facilitate better and sustainable integration provisions and diversify families based on class. The goal is a sustainable development model that promotes upward mobility, ensuring generational growth, development, and wealth building.</p>
<p>We are living in unprecedented times &ndash; and unprecedented times call for unprecedented action. These issues we face are not new but will require a new vision and fortitude to help our communities survive and thrive in the coming years. With co-occurring crises that threaten people&rsquo;s homes and the massive social mobilization over the loss of Black lives and police brutality, one must ask, &lsquo;what do we as a society value more &ndash; American property, or the actual people that inhabit those properties?&rsquo;. If we truly value people and the communities in which they live, we must be willing to take bold action to weather this crisis and build sustainable homes for all.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter is-resized">Millions of people living in the U.S. are struggling to secure one of the most basic of human needs &ndash; a home for themselves and their families, but action to reinforce renters&rsquo; rights in several states is bringing hope in the fight to secure housing as a human right.</figure>
</div>
<p>Oregon, for example, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/02/oregon-gov-kate-brown-signs-nations-first-statewide-rent-control-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made history th</a><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/02/oregon-gov-kate-brown-signs-nations-first-statewide-rent-control-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="i (opens in a new tab)">i</a><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/02/oregon-gov-kate-brown-signs-nations-first-statewide-rent-control-law.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">s year</a> by passing the first statewide <a href="https://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2019/SB608/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">rent control law</a> &ndash; including an emergency clause to put eviction protections into effect immediately. It signaled recognition by state officials on the urgent nature of the dire conditions created for so many by a lack of affordable housing, increased eviction and displacement. It also marked a significant break in the long-held anti-rent control positions held in many states.</p>
<p>Proponents in Colorado, Illinois, and Washington &ndash; as well as in the cities of Philadelphia and Providence, R.I. &ndash; are all hoping to build on years of organizing and activism to reverse decades-old rent control bans to stop the spiral of skyrocketing rents, evictions, home insecurity and the subsequent growing threat to families&rsquo; well-being and access to opportunity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2018/11/16/keeping-renters-in-their-homes-through-collective-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">noted in a previous SPARCC report,</a> more U.S. households are <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/19/more-u-s-households-are-renting-than-at-any-point-in-50-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">headed by renters</a> than at any point since at least 1965. In fact, <a href="https://www.rentcafe.com/blog/rental-market/market-snapshots/change-renter-vs-owner-population-2006-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">renters have become the majority</a> in almost a quarter of the nation&rsquo;s 100 most populous cities. But rising rental costs are out of reach for millions as a result of the economics of market-based housing policy and the nation&rsquo;s long history of systemic and racial inequities, particularly through discriminatory residential planning and zoning practices.</p>
<p>In the recent report, <a href="https://www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/OurHomesOurFuture_Web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Our Homes, Our Future: How Rent Control can Build Stable, Healthy Communities</a> by PolicyLink, the Center for Popular Democracy, and the Right to the City Alliance, it&rsquo;s estimated that nearly 6,300 evictions occur each day in the United States. Eviction Lab estimated that in 2016, 2.3 million evictions were filed in the U.S., with single women of color with children at the top of the list, highlighting the need to focus on women, racial and gender justice in housing.&sup1;</p>
<p>Renter protection laws are crucial to securing housing, enhancing the health and well-being of tenants and protecting against housing vulnerabilities that are exacerbated by natural disasters and climate change.&sup2; And while the list of renter protection legislation is growing, so is <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/05/can-new-york-make-buildings-super-efficient-really-quickly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="legislation that will address climate change (opens in a new tab)">legislation that will address climate change</a> like mandates on energy efficiency and consumption in buildings, which can have a significant benefit for tenants by reducing energy bills.</p>
<p>The following are highlights of several recent actions taken to protect tenants:</p>

<p>Several <a href="https://urbanhabitat.org/sites/default/files/UH%202018%20Strengthening%20Communities%20Through%20Rent%20Control_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">California cities</a> have passed rent control and just-cause evictions policies over the past few years and many more are working to do so. The state-level Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act passed in 1995 limits how cities implement rent control by setting limits on the types of policies that can be passed, and it limits a city&rsquo;s ability to update &ldquo;date of construction&rdquo; provisions in ordinances. The 2018 effort to repeal Costa Hawkins failed, but advocates kept it moving with new packages aimed at protecting renters. The bills below are up for consideration in 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;Keep Families Home&rdquo; package includes three housing bills to protect 17 million tenants across the state of California. The package includes:
<ul>
<li>Anti-Rent Gouging (AB 1482, Chiu) &ndash; protects renters from sudden rent increases by linking rent increases to a formula based on the Consumer Price Index.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Costa Hawkins Reform (AB 36, Bloom) &ndash; reforms state restrictions on local rent control by giving more power to local jurisdictions to amend rent control laws and exempts small landlords from the reforms.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Just Cause Eviction (AB 1481, Bonta) &ndash; extends just-cause eviction protection to every renter by safeguarding against unjust evictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rent Registry (AB724, Wicks) &ndash; proposes to compile state data on evictions and how and where rent is increasing across the state by establishing a rental registry.</li>
<li>Eviction Defense Fund (SB 18) &ndash; funds eviction defense (potentially supporting local efforts for a right to counsel) and emergency rental assistance.</li>
<li>Source of Income Ban (SB 329) &ndash; bans discrimination by landlords against tenants based on their source of income, such as Section 8 Vouchers <em>(see the recently passed legislation in New York below)</em></li>
<li>The proposed Right to Organize legislation (SB29) would protect tenants from eviction and landlord retaliation when they collectively organize or participate in a rent strike or tenant association.</li>
<li>Toward the implementation of the contentious new regional housing plan in the Bay Area &ndash; <a href="https://mtc.ca.gov/sites/default/files/CASA_Compact.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">CASA Compact</a> &ndash; <a href="https://www.cacities.org/Top/News/News-Articles/2019/March/Regional-Housing-Plan-Has-Statewide-Impacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">several legislations</a> have been introduced that would have an impact on the state level. For example, AB1486 would strengthen the Surplus Land Act, clarifying agencies and parcels subject to the surplus land act with the goal of prioritizing affordable housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, several cities and counties across California are now engaged in efforts to launch tenants&rsquo; rights clinics, create local just cause eviction ordinances, create rent stabilization ordinances and train people to organize for renter protections.</p>

<p>There are a series of renter protection bills in the Colorado legislative committee, including a renewed effort to repeal a ban on rent control in the state. Advocates have received some major victories recently, and Colorado renters have gained several critical protections and supports, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Grants for Property Tax Rent and Heat (opens in a new tab)">Grants for Property Tax Rent and Heat</a> (HB19-1085) &ndash; increases property related expense assistance grants for low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rental Application Fees</a> (HB19-1106) &ndash; requires landlords to be transparent by providing information on why potential renters&rsquo; applications were rejected, requires landlords to itemize how they use application fees and refund any unused fees within 20 days.</li>
<li><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Residential Health and Safety Act (opens in a new tab)">Residential Health and Safety Act</a> (HB19-1170) &ndash; enhances the rights of tenants to pressure landlords to maintain healthy living conditions. This bill allows renters to withhold rent if landlords are not properly maintaining units, like dealing with mold which can cause chronic illnesses and make a home unlivable</li>
<li><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Period to Cure Lease Violation</a> (HB19-1118) &ndash; extends the amount of time that tenants have to resolve a problem (such as paying past due rent) before eviction proceedings begin. Currently residents have 3 days to fix violation problems and with some exceptions, new rules would provide a tenant with 10 days.</li>
<li><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extend Notice to Tenant Before Eviction</a> (HB19-1118) &ndash; increase the time given to tenants between notifying tenants of an agreement violation (unpaid rent or other, non-substantial, agreements) and initiating eviction procedures from 3 days to 10 days.</li>
<li><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mobile Home Park Act Oversight (opens in a new tab)">Mobile Home Park Act Oversight</a> (HB19-1309) &ndash; the bill provides a host of protections for mobile home owners, including extending the time period between the notice of nonpayment of rent and the termination of any tenancy.</li>
<li><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Eviction Legal Defense Fund (opens in a new tab)">Eviction Legal Defense Fund</a> (SB19-180) &ndash; establishes an eviction legal defense fund for tenants facing eviction (see <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/547-17/mayor-de-blasio-signs-legislation-provide-low-income-new-yorkers-access-counsel-for#/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> for a similar program in New York City). The fund would provide grants to qualifying non-profit organizations to provide legal representation, counseling and advice to tenants facing eviction.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there is one more bill on the calendar:</p>
<ul>

<p>Housing justice advocates helped lawmakers introduce a suite of bills that represents the most comprehensive renter protection proposal that the state has seen: If passed, <a href="http://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2019/01794/?Tab=RelatedBills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SB1794/HB1283</a> would offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A just cause eviction clause protecting renters from unfair evictions</li>
<li>Requirements for leases to be provided in the preferred language of the renter</li>
<li>A &ldquo;right of first refusal&rdquo; offered to tenants when their buildings are up for sale by the landlords</li>
<li>A rule for landlords to pay back 3 times the cost of the security deposit if the renter&rsquo;s security deposit is not returned within 30 days of the end of a lease</li>
<li>A moratorium on evictions during natural disaster or state of emergency</li>
<li>Protection for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence and sexual abuse</li>
<li>A prohibition against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation</li>
<li>A requirement that application fees be returned in cases in which there are no available units and that landlords must not charge excessive application fees</li>
</ul>

<p>Oregon passed the nation&rsquo;s first statewide rent control bill (SB608) in February 2019. Rent control was banned in the 1980s in Oregon and has made its way back given the housing pressures facing the state. The bill:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes an emergency clause that allows rent control and just cause eviction to go into effect immediately</li>
<li>Caps annual rent increases at 7 percent of the Consumer Price Index</li>
<li>Eliminates &ldquo;no-cause&rdquo; evictions, except during the first year of tenancy. During the first year, landlords can give 30 days written notice for eviction</li>
<li>Exempts new construction for 15 years. Subsidized rent is also exempt, which refers to housing run by private owners who receive subsidies for lower rents to low- and moderate-income people.</li>

<p>New York has the longest history on renters&rsquo; rights in the country, passing the first rent control policy in the 1940s. Advocates scored a victory in April 2019 with the passage of the Source of Income Discrimination bill (S.3303 Parker) (A 5.891 Mosley). The source of income discrimination bill ensures that landlords will not be able to discriminate against tenants based on lawful sources of incomes such as Section 8 Housing Vouchers, veterans benefits, child support, disability benefits and other types of non-wage income. This will impact nearly 600,000 New Yorkers who depend on non-wage income.&sup3; Presented as part of a campaign for housing justice and universal rent control, there are several other bills in session to expand tenant rights across the state, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Good Cause Eviction Bill (SBS2892A/<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/a5030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">A5030A</a>), which would prevent landlords from evicting tenants if they cannot afford a rent increase above an &ldquo;unconscionable&rdquo; amount &mdash; defined as more than 150 percent of the regional Consumer Price Index.The bill would also expand protection to tenants in smaller buildings (with less than 6 units) and manufactured homes. The <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s2892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">bill</a> is now in the Judiciary Committee in the state Senate.</li>
<li>Vacancy Decontrol (S2591/<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/a1198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">A1198</a>), which calls for a repeal of a loophole where apartments become deregulated once the rent reaches a certain amount, causing those units to fall outside of rent control rules. The bill would re-regulate the units.</li>

<p>Cities in Virginia have among the <a href="https://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/map-monday-eviction-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">highest eviction rates</a> in the country. The newly signed legislation to reduce eviction rates is a great step forward for housing security in Virginia. The legislative housing package passed in March 2019 will take effect in July 2019. It includes several specific provisions addressing the statewide eviction crisis, which is the result of both rapidly increasing rents and some of the least tenant-friendly provisions and constitutional limits on local authority. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra time for residents to pay unpaid rent to satisfy a judgment in order to avoid eviction.</li>
<li>Limits on the number of legal actions a landlord can file in court against a tenant, thereby reducing the amount tenants must pay to avoid eviction.</li>
<li>Reducing the period of time during which a landlord can use a court judgment of possession to evict a tenant, providing more stability for tenants.</li>
<li>Reversing financially onerous constraints on tenants wanting to appeal non-payment-of-rent evictions. Under current law, tenants are required to post bond equal to rent for every month their appeal is pending, up to 12 months.</li>
<li>Requiring landlords to provide mutually agreed-upon written leases to the tenant and includes provisions that must be included in the lease.</li>
<li>Establishing four pilot eviction diversion programs involving local governments, legal aid providers and non-profit housing partners.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Bills referenced above include House Bill 1898, 1922 and Senate Bills 1445, 1448, 1627. Additional bills that focus on reducing evictions and increasing housing security include House Bills 2007, 1925 and 2655, Senate Bills 1450, 1626, which have not reached a final vote.)</em></p>

<p>Washington State has had a ban on rent control since 1981, keeping cities from creating any form of rent stabilization policies of their own. An ordinance to lift the ban was introduced in 2018, but didn&rsquo;t pass, upholding the ban on rent control. Following the tenants&rsquo; rights victory in Seattle on eviction and with years of organizing, there are proposals at the state level that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>End evictions without just cause (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1656&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">HB 1656</a> and <a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1453&amp;Year=2019&amp;Initiative=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">HB1453</a>).</li>
<li>Give renters more time to pay past due rent (<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5600&amp;Initiative=false&amp;Year=2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SB5600</a>) and allow judges more discretion in eviction cases. <em>(This law was passed in April 2019 and is awaiting the signature of the Governor)</em></li>

<h2>Cities at a Glance</h2>
<p><em>(This is not a comprehensive list)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong> &ndash; The city passed the Good (Just) Cause Bill requiring landlords to have a just reason for evictions for those with month-to-month leases. (<a href="http://phillytenantsunion.org/just-cause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Philadelphia Tenants Union</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Providence, Rhode Island</strong> &ndash; Advocates are focused on a suite of bills that ask for rent control, just-cause eviction, creation of rent boards, relocation assistance if tenants are displaced as a result of landlord actions and eliminating month-to-month contracts. (<a href="https://www.daretowin.org/current-campaigns/tenant-and-homeowner-association/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Direct Action for Rights and Equality</a>)</li>
<li><strong>San Francisco, California</strong> &ndash;
<ul>
<li>Renters in San Francisco now have the right to free legal counsel when faced with an eviction proceeding with the passage of the Right to Counsel* (Prop F) bill. Tenants can legally get an attorney regardless of income, age, medical status or time they have lived in the city. (<a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/news/tenant-right-to-counsel-moves-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">SF Weekly</a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Through AB 1487 (part of the CASA Compact package), <strong>the bill</strong> would raise and allocate funding that would be used for affordable housing projects, enhance existing affordable housing and fund tenant protection programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*New York City was the first city to implement Right to Counsel in 2017. NYC has since expanded the reach of this program. Newark, N.J., is the third city to implement this program.
