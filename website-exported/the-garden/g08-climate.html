<h1>Fire &amp; Ice: Addressing the Climate Crisis Before It&rsquo;s Too Late</h1>


<header></header>
<article>
<p>By Nick Collins</p>
<p>They say the stars at night are big and bright deep in the heart of Texas. But when <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/03/15/texas-winter-storm-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mother Nature swept in with an unprecedented snowstorm</a> in the Lone Star state the stars were the only thing you could see as massive power and water outages blanketed the state. From Houston to Dallas to Galveston and all points in between, Texas was rocked to its core by freezing temperatures that crippled the state&rsquo;s ill-prepared energy infrastructure. They say everything is bigger in Texas, well, climate change is no exception.</p>
<p>While the rest of the country is largely a part of either the Western or Eastern power grid, Texas wanted to go it alone &ndash; believing that a free market model was best. That model when tested by unprecedented weather conditions led to massive failures of every type of power source including, natural gas, wind, and nuclear. More tragically, it led to 57 deaths from hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, medical equipment failure and fire. In the end, Texas residents were left with unsafe or no drinking water, astronomical energy bills and a bunch of elected officials pointing fingers at each other&hellip;or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ted-cruz-cancun-storm/2021/02/19/ce1dc25e-7252-11eb-93be-c10813e358a2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacationing in Cancun</a>.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not like we didn&rsquo;t see this coming. It&rsquo;s been happening all over the country. Remember those <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/30/california-wildfires-north-complex-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raging wildfires on the West Coast</a> that killed 31 people and scorched over two million acres of land&hellip;that was only about eight months ago. The California fires of last September were the states&rsquo; worst on record. The changing climate has made California increasingly hotter. This coupled with an unusual lightning storm and high winds made the state a powder keg, turning places like the Bay Area into a living hellscape for multiple days.</p>

<p><em>This is the part when the 90&rsquo;s era protagonist breaks the fourth wall, looks into the camera and says, &ldquo;So I bet you&rsquo;re wondering how we got here?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is that these are not anomalies but more of a forecast of things to come. We&rsquo;ve been ignoring what was staring us in the face for years and now we must reckon with our inaction on our changing climate.</p>
<p>Despite conservative thought leaders&rsquo; claims that climate change is &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;, Americans know the truth &ndash; it is very real. A <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-november-2019/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 Yale poll</a> found that more than 7 out of 10 Americans now say that global warming is important to them. As we increasingly see catastrophic climate events devastating the country and globe it becomes harder and more unsustainable to ignore the facts. Yet it&rsquo;s troubling that we may have awoken to the realities of our environmental devastation too late. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/what-if-we-stopped-pretending" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many fear</a> that it&rsquo;s too late to do anything of consequence, that the problem is too complex to solve &ndash; or both.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic further compounds these issues &ndash; leaching resources, sucking dry prospective funding, all while historic climate events pull budgets towards funding emergency responses. This funding drawdown demonstrates one of the most difficult aspects of slowing and reversing the effects of climate change. As catastrophes increase in occurrence, magnitude, and severity, emergency response funds must also increase. And while a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/do-most-americans-believe-climate-change-polls-say-yes/580957/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of Americans</a> are unwilling to contribute even $10 a month to combat climate change, they often are left to foot the bill when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dF5XrvuHX7U" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="lazy"></iframe></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issues around climate change seem increasingly insurmountable. Like a tangled web, climate, health, housing, transportation and wealth determine the sustainability and viability of our communities. As always, communities of color bear the biggest burden and have the poorest outcomes. While Washington continues to wrestle with how to address these issues, the people have begun to embrace <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2021/02/03/our-power-sparcc-introduces-pathways-to-community-prosperity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their power</a> and develop solutions that will address these pressing issues.</p>
<p>Even before the devastating fires of 2020 and the deep freeze of 2021, SPARCC and our partner organizations have been <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2018/12/21/rcva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shouting from the rooftops</a> our need to enact policies that call for robust climate justice to address the growing wildfires, deep freezes and other environmental concerns. Our grassroots approach is centered around gathering community members and presenting them with climate data so that they can make informed decisions on how to invest in making their communities climate resilient. As we move forward into this new administration we intend to double-down on activating these initiatives demonstrating to those at all levels of government how we intend to push for policies that center communities of color and put people first.</p>
<p>The task ahead of us to dismantle centuries &ndash; by some counts, a millennium &ndash; of policy, cultural identity, and outcomes might seem overwhelming, but there are people already doing the work. Hopelessness can only lead us down a path of dread and despair. The answers are right in front of us and they are already in motion. Our communities are responding, and it is up to us to begin to put these pieces together to create a coordinated effort to combat climate change and all of its systemic tentacles to stomp out these fires and create brighter futures.</p>

<h1>Research: Displacement in the Face of Climate Change</h1>


<header></header>
<article>
<p>By Marissa Ramirez</p>
<p>The past five years have been the <a href="https://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/resources/2019-global-temperatures-update-through-september" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warmest ever recorded on record globally</a><strong>, </strong>and spring flooding, hurricane and wildfire seasons are once again upon us, with summer months and their <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/seasonal.php?lead=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected warmer-than-average heat</a> not far behind. Between hurricanes in the southeast and wildfires in California, over <a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/expert-opinion/displacement-and-housing-affordability-in-the-united-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.2 million people were displaced</a> by climate-related disasters in 2018 alone. <strong> </strong></p>
<h3>&gt;&gt; Read the survey report <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Climate-Change-and-Displacement-in-U.S.-Communities.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</h3>
<p>More than ever, where and how we live is being driven by climate change. Climate change and economic disparity lay bare the legacy of intentional, racially discriminatory systems that disproportionately hurt low-income and communities of color. What often happens is that the very solutions that curb emissions and protect from these impacts can also cause displacement. Now, the COVID-19 crisis is further stressing these existing disparities. Renters, with fewer resources and less recovery assistance, are especially vulnerable to displacement during a crisis. Combine that with the fact that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/19/more-u-s-households-are-renting-than-at-any-point-in-50-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more U.S. households are headed by renters</a> than at any point since 1965 &ndash; many of them people of color or low-income with job insecurity in the face of a pandemic &ndash; and you&rsquo;ve got a potential displacement emergency.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Strong, Prosperous, and Resilient Communities Challenge</a> (SPARCC) sponsored a literature review and survey to uncover the links between climate and displacement. Working with the <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Urban Displacement Project</a> (UDP) at the University of California Berkeley and <a href="http://www.ecoadapt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EcoAdapt</a>, SPARCC sought to better understand the interrelationships between the pressures exerted by climate change and the unintended consequences of investments in climate adaptation and mitigation, and how practitioners are working to reduce both climate and displacement risks.</p>

<h2><strong>Research findings</strong></h2>
<p>The literature review synthesized findings from 384 studies, reports, and articles published from the 1970s to today and shows historically significant inequities in that persist today. In coastal states like New Jersey, housing continues to be built more rapidly in flood prone places than in low risk areas. As a result, these coastal communities are directly affected by floodwaters while nearby areas face the indirect risk of displacement due to the housing shortages that result when receiving people exiting the flood zones.</p>
<h3>&gt;&gt; Read the literature review <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Climate-and-Displacement-Lit-Review-6.19.2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</h3>
<p>The accompanying national survey of 179 respondents spanned multiple sectors (e.g. housing, parks, environmental justice, or transit). It found that for 74 percent of practitioners, day-to-day issues such as the cost and availability of affordable housing ranked as their highest priorities &ndash; above climate change impacts. However, an overwhelming 91 percent agreed that climate change is having or is likely to have a significant effect on their communities, with 64 percent taking direct action to address the effects of climate change. Barriers to taking action on climate included money and resources, in addition to a lack of technical expertise and clarity on viable options.</p>
<h3>&gt;&gt; Read the survey report <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Climate-Change-and-Displacement-in-U.S.-Communities.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</h3>
<p>The literature also found that green investments including housing near transit and parks enhance our resilience to climate change by lowering emissions or absorbing floodwaters, but their benefits can be tempered by higher housing costs. Energy-efficient infrastructure and rooftop solar also lead to higher housing values, potentially countering the effect of lower energy costs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to figure out how to stabilize these neighborhoods, and improve their resilience, without spurring displacement,&rdquo; offered one survey respondent.</p>
<h2><strong>Resilient solutions from communities</strong></h2>
<p>Encouragingly, as stated, 64 percent of respondents are, in fact, taking into account climate change in their work, motivated by climate justice and equity values. These practitioners are especially focused on community engagement and offering a diversity of housing options or co-locating reliable transit and affordable housing.</p>

<p>In Atlanta, for example, the SPARCC partner the <a href="https://psequity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partnership for Southern Equity</a> (PSE) was noted as a case example for focusing on connecting communities and increasing quality of life through its Equitable Transit-Oriented Development program. PSE is working with the <a href="https://atlantaregional.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta Regional Commission</a> to engage community members in transit planning and understanding transit needs so the city can become less car-dependent while avoiding displacement.</p>
<p>Practitioners surveyed offered other ideas, including prioritizing more ways to integrate passive heating and cooling in affordable housing, relocating people out of vulnerable areas and protecting future land for housing, as well as implementing transitional housing programs for those who are displaced. As in the literature review, community land trusts (CLT) &ndash; nonprofit corporations that develop and oversee affordable housing and other community assets on behalf of a community &ndash; and community ownership of land were identified as anti-displacement strategies that may help increase community resilience.</p>
<p>In one example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNbjXzgnR88&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ca&ntilde;o Mart&iacute;n Pe&ntilde;a CLT</a> in Puerto Rico allowed residents to return more quickly than other areas after Hurricane Maria. CLTs like this may allow communities to rebuild without the risk of climate-driven gentrification.</p>
<p>Our research affirms that the environment, housing, health, racial equity, and economic opportunity are inextricably linked. While there may be a gap between what is being done and what <em>can</em> be done, the survey underscored that displacement and gentrification don&rsquo;t have to be inevitable in making our cities climate ready.</p>
<h2><strong>Opportunities</strong></h2>
<p>There is an opportunity to continue to find creative ways to elevate and implement innovative policies and solutions that are being identified by those experiencing the interconnections first-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a need for a countywide mandate for anti-displacement that brings together different agencies [&hellip;] to look at development with an anti-displacement lens and language to keep residents in place as healthy developments grow,&rdquo; stated a survey respondent.</p>
<p>The research also shows that while anti-displacement policies have the potential to mitigate the threats of climate change and other public health threats, supporting thoughtful and informed leadership by local jurisdictions and communities is key to the timing and effectiveness of putting those policies into practice. While we don&rsquo;t yet know how this current health and economic crisis will affect housing in America how we respond during this time may inform our ability to respond to climate change. A major takeaway is that strategies that consider the links between disasters, health, equity, and community investment &ndash; and that put people at the forefront &ndash; can create long-term solutions and more resilient and equitable places to live.</p>

<h1>We Can&rsquo;t Afford to Cut Affordable Housing</h1>

<article>
<p>Climate-related disasters <a href="https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">displaced over 1.7 million Americans</a> in 2020 alone. This figure doesn&rsquo;t include the increasing displacement caused by secondary effects of climate change&mdash;the decrease in affordability, the rising cost of energy, and the loss of land via erosion.</p>
<p>Without significant investments to increase the supply of affordable housing, federal efforts to <strong>Build Back Better</strong> will fail to meaningfully advance racial and economic equity, and our country will miss an opportunity to embed climate resiliency in the fabric of our neighborhoods, particularly in low-income and BIPOC communities, which have been largely overlooked. The more than $300 billion in housing and community development programs passed by the House Financial Services Committee last month present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize long-neglected communities, ensure safe and affordable housing for all who need it, and close the racial wealth gap.</p>
<h3>Fewer affordable homes means less resilient American families</h3>
<p>More than ever, where and how we live is being driven by climate change. Climate change and economic disparity lay bare the legacy of intentional, racially discriminatory systems that disproportionately hurt low-income and communities of color. Renters, with fewer resources and less recovery assistance, are especially vulnerable to displacement during a crisis. Combine that with the fact that more <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/19/more-u-s-households-are-renting-than-at-any-point-in-50-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. households are headed by renters</a> than at any point since 1965 and you&rsquo;ve got a recipe for massive displacement.</p>
<p>Climate crises&mdash;<em>e.g.</em> a flooded roof, <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2021/04/21/fire-ice-addressing-the-climate-crisis-before-its-too-late/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ice storm, fire</a>&mdash;are an external shock to households that may not have the reserves to weather the storm. As <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/census-income-rent-gap-grew-in-2018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rental rates continue to soar</a> while income remains essentially stagnant, it&rsquo;s becoming more and more difficult for households to save at all. College tuition becomes less within reach, and unexpected expenses like medical bills or car repairs become more frequent and harder to cover. The unfolding climate crisis is adding an additional set of external shocks to U.S. households that are already strapped for cash.</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, we know that housing affordability means families are more likely to stay in place and able to absorb any sort of external shock.</strong></p>
<h3>Fewer affordable homes means worse health outcomes for Americans</h3>
<p>The mental and physical <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180313.396577/full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefits of housing stability</a> are critical as we face an increasing amount of climate stressors, including additional mental and physical burdens on every day families. Climate related stressors&mdash;<a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2021/06/28/extreme-heat-has-extreme-health-implications-how-cities-and-policies-need-to-adapt-to-a-warming-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like extreme heat</a>&mdash;require new design and adaptation of the built environment. This starts by addressing historically racist housing policies. Without adequate federal support, money won&rsquo;t flow to cities attempting to redress these legacies and the most vulnerable communities&mdash;often low-income and disproportionately people of color&mdash;will experience the brunt of health issues brought on by climate change.</p>
<p>The only way to stop these compounding inequities is a large, intentional investment in our infrastructure. Housing is a foundational part of that infrastructure. Without comprehensive funding for housing, we risk building on the same inequitable legacies that we are working to remand. With worsening health outcomes, we&rsquo;ll continue to increase medical expenses across the country and mortality rates because of climate-related health complications will continue to rise.</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, we know that housing stability leads to better health outcomes.</strong></p>
<h3>Fewer affordable homes means a less energy efficient America</h3>
<p>Energy, water, health, and resilience upgrades <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2021/10/06/climate-resilience-for-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce long-term savings in energy usage</a>, financial cost, and environmental impact, yet the barriers like time, budget, and access to technical services make accessing these options almost impossible for a typical American household.</p>
<p>Assessing the potential options available to help building developers save energy and determining which may qualify for available subsidies is time-consuming and requires a vast knowledge of all the available funds. Piecing together funds from multiple sources, or not qualifying for funding sources altogether leads many building developers or families to skip this step entirely. The upfront costs and technical gaps result in projects that go forward with little to no resilience upgrades, leaving out entire families, small businesses, and neighborhoods, disproportionately in low-income and BIPOC communities.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more is that this leaves BIPOC communities to take on the additional, compounding costs of climate change through continual building repairs, negative health impacts, and ultimately, displacement.</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, we know that to make a more energy efficient America for everyone, we need to invest in affordable housing.</strong></p>
<p>Dedicating funding for <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/pathways-to-prosperity/community-stewardship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community-based housing options</a> such as community land trusts and other shared-equity models that prioritize racial equity help to preserve and develop housing that is both climate resilient and affordable for the long-term. Where housing is located and how it is designed matters to reducing household costs and improving resiliency. This requires better coordination of housing and transportation including strategies like <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/pathways-to-prosperity/etod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equitable transit-oriented development (eTOD)</a> to include affordable housing as a critical part of resilient, healthy, and economically viable neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We have a once in-a-generation opportunity to invest meaningfully in improving racial equity, and to build homes for a climate uncertain future. To build back better, we need a future where families can remain in their homes. We must invest in affordable, climate resilient housing.</p>

<h1>4 Steps to a Climate Savvy Community</h1>


<header></header>
<article>
<p>In 2018, SPARCC shared its <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2018/12/21/rcva/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rapid Climate Vulnerability Assessment (RCVA): A New Way to Measure Vulnerability.</a></p>
<p>In partnership with SPARCC and EcoAdapt, we are excited to share an updated <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RCVA_REPORT_SINGLEPG-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RCVA guide</a>, a simple, four-step process designed to evaluate community vulnerability to climate change while collaboratively finding solutions.</p>
<h3>&gt;&gt; Download RCVA: <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RCVA_REPORT_SINGLEPG-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single page format </a>and<a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RCVA_REPORT_SPREADS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> spread format</a></h3>
<h2>Why We Created This Rapid Climate Vulnerability Assessment Tool</h2>
<p>Communities are places of family, friends, culture, work and play &ndash; and they are under tremendous stress. From record development in some places to disinvestment in others, communities are addressing increased traffic and air pollution, aging infrastructure, a lack of affordable housing while facing increased exposure to climate change in the form of flooding, drought, and extreme temperatures. As climate change and its effects grow, the way communities are structured and built becomes more important in counteracting and preventing those effects &ndash; for the health and safety of all residents.</p>
<p>RCVAs enable people to see where community vulnerabilities intersect with climate stressors. Vulnerability assessments aren&rsquo;t new. Natural resource managers have been using them to document and adapt to climate change events for over a decade. But use of an RCVA by communities for local planning (development, services, resources) is just beginning. This particular tool was developed for the Strong, Prosperous and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC) to create climate-savvy investments that perpetuate inclusive, equitable, sustainable community development practices that also contribute to community health and well-being. Designed and piloted with some SPARCC communities, the RCVA allows users to quickly identify core challenges, immediate interventions, and resources to support climate informed actions going forward.</p>
<h2>Who uses an RCVA?</h2>
<p>An RCVA is not conducted for a community, but by a community. Anyone can undertake an RCVA, although they are typically initiated by cities or other regional planning authorities. Increasingly, there is a need for community focused RCVAs as participation and buy-in across diverse stakeholders results in more equitable solutions, which can be critical for community resilience. The perspective of residents and local leaders in community-focused RCVAs to build solutions grounded in community history and local assets often not represented in external assessments.</p>
