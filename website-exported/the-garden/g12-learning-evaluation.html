<h1>Igniting Systems Change</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p>By Stephanie Gidigbi</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/resources/igniting-systems-change/" target="blank">The Systems Change Guide</a> explores several key SPARCC concepts and approaches to advance systems change. It spotlights regional efforts and serves as a guide to actualize systems change from theory to reality. It also includes an appendix of tools &amp; resources to assess and prioritize systems change activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Research shows that place as well as race matter and that both impact life expectancy and social economic mobility. While recent attention has been paid to cities experiencing rapid economic growth and development, less is reported about the vast majority seeing higher and more concentrated rates of poverty.</p>
<p>We live in a society of interconnected systems, structured by the &ldquo;norms&rdquo; of an America built on class and race. From our roads to our homes, social inequities are embedded in the concrete of our foundation as a nation. Government policies from the 1950s, such as redlining, continue to negatively impact communities of color &ndash; a situation that puts many once-thriving neighborhoods and regions at a competitive disadvantage. Highways divide us from our neighbors because of infrastructure built on American inequality and our collective investment in structural racism that devalues the moral and economic fabric of the country.</p>
<p>If current and past development trends remain the same, patterns of segregation, concentrated poverty and displacement will fail to meet the needs of America&rsquo;s increasingly diverse population. However, there is an opportunity to disrupt the status quo and produce better outcomes for everyone. Over the next decade, the public sector alone will invest trillions of dollars in communities across the country to help reshape the built environment.</p>
<p>As a nation, we simply can&rsquo;t afford more of the same failed approaches &ndash; economically, socially or environmentally. We must divest from the systemic inequalities that divide us and invest in equitable development&mdash;a range of approaches for creating healthy, vibrant, and sustainable communities where residents of all incomes, races, and ethnicities have access to transportation options, affordable homes, clean air and water, and basic rights to thrive.</p>
<p>Achieving racial equity requires an intentional commitment and inclusive approach that supports the empowerment of people to transform systems that allocate power and resources, in order to create communities where all people, regardless of race or origin, have equitable access to thrive.</p>
<p>The Strong Prosperous and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC) ignites a systems change approach for altering the status quo through innovative practices and inclusive policy solutions that influence and institutionalize how communities plan, design and invest in community development projects to achieve a broader range of racial justice, health, climate, and community benefits. SPARCC seeks to advance an <strong>integrated vision for the future that considers and holistically addresses the interrelated root causes of racial inequity, health disparities, and climate vulnerabilities.</strong></p>

<h1>SPARCC: What We&rsquo;ve Learned May Surprise You</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p>The Strong, Prosperous, and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC) has a bold mission to change the way regions grow, invest, and build. The initiative kicked off two years ago as a partnership across a range of funders and nonprofit organizations from across the country to create new approaches to equitable regional development, focusing on three areas or &ldquo;lenses&rdquo; &ndash; health, racial equity, and climate change.</p>
<p>Midway through our project we took an in-depth look at how this initiative is working, how it can stand as a model for others and how we can turbocharge this effort in the next phase. We revisited some of our original hypotheses and took time to reflect on what we&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<p>So, how have our assumptions played out? A new report based on a series of interviews gave us a lot of answers.</p>
<h2>Check out the full the report <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Testing-Our-Hypotheses-on-Equitable-Development.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a>.</h2>
<p>Laura Choi of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco&rsquo;s community development research team interviewed 15 people representing the six SPARCC regions&mdash;Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Denver&mdash; to better understand their experience in testing these hypotheses over the first half of the initiative.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis 1: Equitable development requires looking at the work <em>simultaneously</em> through the integrated &ldquo;lenses&rdquo; of racial equity, health, and climate.</h3>
<p>In testing this hypothesis, we learned that despite our theory on the three lenses, racial equity has emerged as primary. SPARCC site participants from areas of health, climate and community development told us <strong>the main lens of racial equity is at the root of most of the challenges communities face today and it is the one that all others should flow through</strong>. As one team member put it, &ldquo;If we want to make systemic changes, &hellip; we realized we had to start with racial equity then look at these other outcomes [health and climate] through that lens.&rdquo; Thus, in all six SPARCC regions, these new alliances and collaborative tables&mdash;looking through multiple lenses&mdash;forced a conversation and stark conclusion that may never have occurred otherwise.</p>
<p>We also learned that displacement pressure, particularly among communities of color, is a common backdrop to the work in all of the SPARCC regions, leading us to hold a <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/iwd-2018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="350-participant gathering (opens in a new tab)">350-participant gathering</a> in Los Angeles at the close of 2018. The day-long event explored strategies that can help cities and regions around the country achieve equitable, inclusive growth informed by the voices, needs, and interests of those communities most threatened by growing displacement pressures.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis 2: Achieving equitable outcomes requires engaging the community to build a shared vision and the power to implement change.</h3>
<p>Although the underlying spirit of our second hypothesis that community engagement is key rang true for all of the sites, SPARCC regions are prioritizing a new, <strong>more expansive definition of the concept&mdash;</strong> one that includes true partnership with community members built over time. SPARCC sites emphasized that true community engagement is built on shared power and, importantly, acknowledgement of the ways power has been stripped from communities of color in the past.</p>
<h3>Hypothesis 3: A formal cross-sector leadership table at the regional scale is a necessary component of effecting systems change.</h3>
<p>SPARCC sites told us that their <strong>hard work building cross-sector leadership at the regional scale was incredibly valuable</strong> and was a key component of effecting systems change. Partners told us that aligning cross-sector actors within the region is complex and challenging and they often had to balance an understanding of multiple problems at the same time.</p>
<p>But this, they said, is when the magic happens.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;The solution to a complex problem like racial inequity has to be complex too. It has to be cross-sector and long term. It&rsquo;s only when you bring them all together that you arrive at &lsquo;aha&rsquo; moments.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Hypothesis 4: Flexible financing is necessary to encourage capital deployment and effect regional change.</h3>
<p>Finally, SPARCC&rsquo;s collaboration shows <strong>the need for a new definition of flexible financing</strong>. SPARCC makes available a pool financing capital to support sites in developing projects that advance racial equity, health, and climate resilience. Sites told us capital needs to be truly flexible, that incremental flexibility within an inherently rigid capital system is insufficient for effecting the kind of transformation communities need. They pointed to the importance of things like speed and responsiveness, especially in rapidly appreciating real estate markets.</p>
<h3>Flexibility and adaptation</h3>
<p>This learning has led us to make some important conceptual adaptations to SPARCC&rsquo;s model going forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, racial equity is the primary lens that drives health and climate outcomes.</li>
<li>Second, SPARCC&rsquo;s capital strategy now has a more defined focus on approaches that are community-informed and driven.</li>
<li>The SPARCC National Team is working to shift its mindset from being an intermediary/funder to an equal partner with the sites. Together, the SPARCC sites and the SPARCC national team are focusing on policy, capital, and collaborative effectiveness as key strategies for effecting systems change</li>
<li>And finally the team is working on achieving greater clarity on short-term outcomes for SPARCC&rsquo;s work.</li>
</ul>
<p>With SPARCC&rsquo;s ambitions and goals, we knew flexibility and adaptation would be our watchwords. We have learned that we need to better recognize the need for human-centered program design and the development of new networks and relationships among people, not just capital and policy. We have also learned to create greater clarity on short-term outcomes while being appreciative that long-term change is occurring. As we look forward, we are reframing some basic approaches as our understanding grows of the agency and power of the community as its own driving force toward change.</p>
<p>We look forward to our continued community partnerships as SPARCC unfolds.</p>

<p>Since its formation in 2017, the Strong, Prosperous, and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC) has had an exacting goal &ndash; help shift decades of racially discriminatory policies and investments that have resulted in harmful disparities in health and climate resilience in communities throughout the United States.</p>
<p>SPARCC&rsquo;s effort to address the barriers facing communities of color and low-income neighborhoods has meant advancing a community-driven development model, and after three years, we&rsquo;ve learned some important lessons. These lessons feel even more important in light of the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, which is <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cases-deaths-race-income-disparities-unequal-f6fb6977-56a1-4be9-8fdd-844604c677ec.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disproportionately affecting communities of color</a>.</p>
<p>SPARCC&rsquo;s work takes place in six sites: Atlanta, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and Memphis. Four national organizations provided support and funding through 2019, including <a href="https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enterprise Community Partners</a> (Enterprise), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF), the <a href="http://www.liifund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Low Income Investment Fund</a> (LIIF), and the<a href="http://www.nrdc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Natural Resources Defense Council</a> (NRDC).</p>

<p>The Center for Community Health and Evaluation (<a href="https://www.kpwashingtonresearch.org/about-us/ghri-centers/center-community-health-and-evaluation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CCHE</a>), SPARCC&rsquo;s evaluation partner with funding from the <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</a>, undertook the task of assessing the initiative&rsquo;s first phase. It conducted analyses of extensive data on projects and outcomes, and interviewed SPARCC participants and partners at the local, regional and national levels.</p>
<p>It sought to answer the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To what extent has SPARCC advanced changes in the systems that shape investments in neighborhoods, with the goal of racially equitable, healthy, and climate-resilient communities?</li>
<li>What is driving or impeding SPARCC progress?</li>
<li>What can be learned from SPARCC about promoting inclusive investment and integrated systems change?</li>
</ol>
<p>The evaluation assessed systems change by looking at how SPARCC contributed to shifts in five conditions in the field of community development. (See figure <em>Systems Change Framework</em>, right).</p>

<p>SPARCC funded collaborative tables as a core element of its theory of change to formalize multi-sector relationships and facilitate collaboration, and the research showed that working with new partners across an expanded network has been one of SPARCC&rsquo;s most valuable outcomes.</p>
<p>All sites developed new relationships and collaboration among partners who had never worked together, while approaches to collaboration varied.</p>
<p>Sites were responsive to their own contexts, and differed in the way they engaged membership, fostered community leadership, amplified community voices and made decisions. Most sites established or strengthened formal collaborative structures, while some established a network, or &ldquo;table of tables,&rdquo; bringing together several existing collaboratives under a more informal umbrella.</p>
<p>Multi-sector collaboration and leading adaptive work, the research found, takes significant skill, time, and resources. Sites that invested more time and effort in building their collaborative infrastructure saw more payoff in outcomes (i.e., community power and leadership, capital resource investment, and policy and practice change). Challenges included leadership turnover; integration of table members into a preexisting structure; and coalescing diverse organizations. <a>Some sites encountered</a> inherent challenges in SPARCC&rsquo;s design as a regional initiative with local focus areas.</p>

<h2><strong>Shifting Power and Mindsets in Community Development</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Mindsets: leading with racial equity</em></h3>
<p>The SPARCC initiative strengthened its emphasis on racial equity over time, which brought energy, momentum, new ways of working, and new partners to the collaboratives. A focus on racial equity has also given cover and credibility to anti-racism work within local power centers and pushed constructive dialogue.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&ldquo;<em>SPARCC has helped us grow and incorporate new lenses of climate and health and allowed us to lead with racial equity. We always had equity in &lsquo;e&rsquo;TOD but people didn&rsquo;t want to hear about it. SPARCC gave us power and permission and stability to lead with racial equity.&rdquo;</em></p>
<cite><em>&ndash; Atlanta table member</em></cite></blockquote>
<h3><em>Community power drives change</em></h3>
<p>Supporting and harnessing community leadership and power is also core to SPARCC&rsquo;s model.Tables created new processes for obtaining community input, provided resources for community power building, and added capacity to engage in capital and policy work. Community leadership and power also drove capital investments and started to shift the community development paradigm in some places.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>When Google bought public land near a transit station in the Bay Area, the local SPARCC table brought its influence, securing seats for residents on a steering committee and bringing research on local rent impacts. These and related grassroots advocacy efforts pushed Google to commit to $1 billion in housing investments (5,000 affordable homes), including affordable housing benefits in the public land it bought, and to establishing a $250 million investment fund to support affordable housing.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Resources: Financial support for built environment projects</em></h3>
<p>SPARCC disbursed over $3.4 million across 25 capital projects (including one loan) to historically disinvested communities, and the result has had positive benefits. Capital work was supported by having a champion with capital expertise, having potential borrowers connected to the table, and developing a pipeline of projects in alignment with communities&rsquo; priorities.Using SPARCC debt to finance projects at sites took longer than anticipated, partly due to ongoing tension between projects that are feasible to finance with SPARCC debt resources and communities&rsquo; own priorities. The SPARCC national team began adapting its support and resources accordingly.</p>
<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-group">
<div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>In Denver, the Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) Pilot Program provides moderate and low-income families the opportunity to build wealth by renting out secondary structures built in their backyards. This program addresses equity within economic opportunity and mitigates displacement by offering affordable housing. This program was made possible through a $250,000</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><em>Policy &amp; practices: Shifting how development happens</em></h3>
<p>Sites reported a tension between working at the regional level while trying to mobilize and build community power and often found it important to do the local work first. At the same time, sites were able to strengthen their positions as regional actors to help stop displacement. A focus on regional agencies like transit proved impactful.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In Chicago, Elevated Chicago&rsquo;s recommendations on eTOD were influential to the City&rsquo;s process in amending and updating its TOD ordinance. The City&rsquo;s eTOD amendment includes strategies aimed at avoiding displacement of residences and businesses, reinvesting in low-income communities and communities of color, supporting equitable transit investment, and ensuring appropriate density levels and parking aligned with neighborhood needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the national level, some of the most promising outcomes to-date may be changes within the national implementing organizations. This included explicitly naming &ldquo;racial equity&rdquo; as an outcome goal in strategic plans and processes, providing anti-racist and anti-bias trainings, and embedding the SPARCC frame of racial equity, health, and climate resilience into long-term work.</p>

<h2><strong>The Next Phase</strong></h2>
<p>SPARCC is elevating gaps and opportunities in the field of community development, bringing new partners together, influencing local policy, raising issues of race in local power centers, and changing mindsets. Equally important, SPARCC values have influenced the national implementing organizations in how they prioritize and advance racial equity internally and externally in their work. SPARCC has received funding for a second phase in which it will continue to hone its unique model for philanthropic community development.</p>

<h1>SPARCC&rsquo;ing Change Where We Work: The Power of Funding Transformation</h1>
</header>
<article>
<p>A formal assessment by the Center for Community Health and Evaluation (CCHE) takes a look at SPARCC&rsquo;s mid-initiative progress, with trends aligning with a <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2019/01/15/sparcc-what-weve-learned-may-surprise-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco&rsquo;s (FRBSF) community development research team</a>, <em><a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Testing-Our-Hypotheses-on-Equitable-Development.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Testing our Hypotheses (opens in a new tab)">Testing our Hypotheses</a></em>.</p>
<h2>Read the full CCHE report <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SPARCC-Mid-Initiative-Evaluation-Report-FINAL-Dec.-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a>.</h2>
<p>Much like the FRBSF&rsquo;s findings, this report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlights the shift to racial equity as a primary lens with which to view the SPARCC work.</li>
<li>Points out the importance of the SPARCC Capital Screen &mdash; a tool that allows rethinking community investment and ensure that capital is applied equitably.</li>
</ul>
<p>CCHE looks at SPARCC&rsquo;s progress-to-date by splitting the initiative outcomes into two categories &mdash; progress in collaboration and community engagement, and progress toward changing the systems of community development.</p>
<p>Among the findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than half of the collaborative tables have increased the number of community residents at the table.</li>
<li>Cross-site collaboration produced four innovation grant proposals, resulting in two grants totalling around $350,000.</li>
<li>Nearly all SPARCC sites are coordinating with local elected officials and agency leaders to influence local and regional policies and have had success bringing resident voices into the process of developing and implementing policies.</li>
<li>The city of Denver and the LA Metro joined the Government Alliance on Race and Equity (GARE).</li>
<li>SPARCC sites have increased strategic data capabilities of their collaborations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also looks at how SPARCC is informing the field and catalyzing change. By analyzing changes in national partner organizations and strategic dissemination, CCHE makes the case that SPARCC has influence &mdash; and it&rsquo;s growing.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>SPARCC has fostered changes in the national initiative organizations, Enterprise Community Partners, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Low Income Investment Fund, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The organizations are increasing their practices and integration of racial equity by explicitly naming &ldquo;racial equity&rdquo; as an outcome goal in strategic plans and processes, providing trainings, embedding the SPARCC frame of health, climate resilience, and racial equity into long-term organizational work, and informing the evolution of other initiatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report offers considerations for funders undertaking highly collaborative and innovative initiatives, specifically advising trusting and flexible relationships between those doing the work.</p>

<h2>Lighting a SPARCC to Fight Displacement</h2>

<h1>The Urgency to Build the Public Will to Tackle Displacement</h1>
</header>
<article>
<h3>By Dr. Tiffany Manuel (<a href="https://twitter.com/DrTiffanyManuel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@DrTiffanyManuel (opens in a new tab)">@DrTiffanyManuel</a>)</h3>
<p>All across the country, there is an explicit public conversation going on about gentrification and displacement.</p>
<p>While such topics have been fodder for debate and analysis in academic circles, they are not ones that typically lead the nightly news or play out in contentious PTA meetings. Today, however, that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening&ndash; creating a perfect storm that may get us to rethink how policymakers and communities should tackle these issues.</p>
<p>A perfect storm arises from a rare combination of unpredictable factors, and the ones at play here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An administration&rsquo;s rhetoric that has polarized the nation around issues of place, race, and inequality</li>
<li>Rapidly changing demographics, sometimes called the &ldquo;browning of America,&rdquo; that may be changing how Americans see themselves, their communities, and the neighbors around them</li>
<li>Widening economic inequality</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues by themselves could sustain gale-force winds in the public consciousness but they accompany a national crisis in housing that brings them directly into our streets and neighborhoods. The severity of the national shortage of housing is driving up housing costs across the country&ndash; upending communities that have long been home to low-income residents and many people of color, displacing them to the outer edges of cities and reinforcing long-standing patterns of segregation.</p>
<p>As this dynamic has played out, contentious battles over the siting of affordable housing in neighborhoods large and small are erupting, as everyday people try to make sense of the rapidly changing racial, economic and spatial dynamics in their communities. As such, issues like zoning and land use policy&ndash; typically of interest only to policy wonks&ndash; today bring people out to community meetings voicing as much passion as in local football or baseball games.</p>

</center>
<p>Housing and community development advocates are wading into the erratic eye of this tempest despite the challenges, to take advantage of one of the best opportunities we have had in years to advance real solutions to the interconnected institutional policies that have preserved the boundaries of poverty, race, and class inequalities in our communities. With better data than ever to underscore alternative (and more equitable and inclusive) development models, people are pushing hard to find real solutions.</p>
<p>Gentrification and displacement are &ldquo;hot topics&rdquo; debated on television news programs, at political rallies, artists&rsquo; spoken-word forums, in newspapers, and online. As one recent headline put it starkly- <a href="https://slate.com/business/2017/10/the-housing-crisis-has-left-very-low-income-families-with-virtually-no-affordable-apartments-on-the-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">&ldquo;Poor people are running out of places to live.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>With the housing supply so low but demand so high, we are seeing fierce battles playing out in communities all across the country over <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2018/01/30/gets-live-answer-may-settled-narratives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">who gets to live where and why</a>. Where do we add density? Where can we rezone to support the creation of new housing? And in high-cost housing cities, how can we preserve what little affordable housing is left?</p>
<p>Many of us have been excited and encouraged by the sudden and frequent reporting on these issues. We have been encouraged because the news brings more visibility and broader acknowledgement that displacement is a problem worthy of public deliberation. And, we have also been eager to center the voices of people experiencing displacement to authentically elevate the public discourse.</p>
<p>On these grounds, we are right to be encouraged. Yet media attention comes with a slew of risks and potential setbacks when we lose nuanced storytelling that actually benefits the kind of <a href="http://www.thecasemade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Strategic CaseMaking&trade;</a> that we need to build stronger public will. Many news stories, for example, don&rsquo;t talk about the history of redlining, restrictive covenants, and other exclusionary policies, or the dangerously high levels of economic inequality that are exacerbating segregation across our cities and towns.</p>
<p>The way the story usually goes is that higher income people make individual choices to move into poor neighborhoods and lower income people make corresponding individual choices to move out. This misses the importance of the systems that set these so-called choices in motion, ignoring the bigger issues&mdash; that low-income people are being displaced either because long-term disinvestment in the infrastructure of their communities has turned around, creating market pressures, or disinvestment has gotten so bad that the communities have become virtually unlivable. Such situations aren&rsquo;t easily communicated in 30-second sound bites.</p>
<h3><strong>The Good News is We Can Take Back the Public Discourse</strong></h3>
<p>As challenging as the situation is, advocates across the country are starting to understand how to take back the public discourse and build stronger public will around these issues.</p>
<p>At the SPARCC <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/iwd-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Investment without Displacement</a> convening in December 2018, for example, hundreds of advocates came together to compare notes, share ideas, and build their capacity for action. In a plenary session that I moderated with my colleague <a href="https://www.raceforward.org/about/staff/jeff-chang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Jeff Chang</a> at RaceForward, we focused on the importance of shapeshifting the public conversation so that the narratives on displacement can be better understood.</p>
<p>A follow-up <a href="https://youtu.be/RPc-hbFOMgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">webinar</a> that I led earlier this year focused more squarely on building the public will to scale solutions, providing evidence-based strategies for surviving the backfire that occurs when we are not strategic and intentional about how we make the case for systems change. In a follow-up <a href="https://www.thecasemade.com/resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">brief</a>, I summarized the dominant narratives on displacement, discussed why those narratives have been so challenging for us to overcome, and provided a set of recommendations to help us begin to do so.</p>
<p>Taken together, along with a growing body of <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/displacement/displacement-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">online resources</a> to support advocates of equitable and inclusive development, we are capitalizing on this growing national conversation and building the bigger tent we need to scale policies, programs and investments that build inclusive places.</p>
