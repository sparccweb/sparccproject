<h1 dir="ltr">Democratizing Data to Advance Community Ownership and Tenant Power</h1>


<p dir="ltr">By Maggie Lea, Maria Pati&ntilde;o Gutierrez, and Philip Verma</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the economy continuing to falter and pandemic protections expiring around the country, <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3769073-rents-and-evictions-are-skyrocketing-we-need-national-housing-security/">America&rsquo;s crisis of housing instability </a>persists. Evictions, poor building conditions, and sudden rent increases threatened the social and cultural fabric of our neighborhoods and cities long before the emergence of Covid-19, and they remain a feature of our dysfunctional housing market. For tenant advocates, researchers, and other community-based organizations seeking to mitigate these trends, it can be difficult to get a clear picture as problems arise. Where does one even begin to find data on eviction filings or habitability issues? The lack of availability to concise and clear information extends to other pressing issues, like what tenant protections are in place and relevant? And who really owns that building? At the end of the day, those on the frontlines of the housing struggle are trying to answer a basic question - to what extent are my neighbors at risk of displacement from eviction, foreclosure, or other causes outside of their control?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Historically, tenants and other community members have had difficulty finding answers to these questions. Even when this data is technically public, many agencies do not make it easy to find or use. On the other hand, corporate landlords and institutional investors have access to an array of proprietary data that help them maximize the profitability of their investments, target distressed properties, and screen out tenants with eviction records or low credit scores. They are also able to use ownership structures such as LLCs to <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2022/08/22/public-land-records-public-purpose-and-public-policy/">further obscure who owns properties and when they are changing hands</a>. So it&rsquo;s not surprising that renters and community organizations are often at an information disadvantage when properties are sold or foreclosed on, or when tenants are at risk of displacement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, there&rsquo;s a growing group of advocates like us fighting to level the informational playing field with new data tools that build tenant power and facilitate community ownership of housing. Thanks to support from the Strong, Prosperous and Resilient Communities Challenge (<a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/">SPARCC</a>), groups in three different cities (Los Angeles, Denver, and Oakland) have developed data tools that help communities resist speculation and displacement while supporting community control of housing and real estate. Being part of the SPARCC network also enabled learning across cities; for example, both Oakland and Denver were inspired in part by a webinar led by the L.A. team in 2020, and we all came together in 2022 to share updates and learnings at SPARCC&rsquo;s October Homecoming event in New Orleans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Through the tools we have developed, community groups are proving that data in the hands of residents, nonprofits, and local businesses empowers them to stay in place safely and by choice, overcome systemic barriers, and increase opportunities to thrive. As data is made accessible and harnessed into a user-friendly platform that is designed by those who will benefit from it, local communities can fight displacement and ensure inclusive and equitable development in their neighborhoods.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Data Tools Developed for Community</h2>
<p dir="ltr">For each of the three tools described below, community-based organizations and data experts responded to the unique circumstances in their cities and the needs of community members fighting for housing justice. These independent projects rely on different web platforms, data sources, and development processes, but all seek to expand access and transparency around key building and neighborhood conditions affecting renters.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.ownit.la">OWN-IT!</a>: The Organizer&rsquo;s Warning and Notification for Tenants (OWN-IT!) tool was created by Strategic Actions for a Just Economy<a href="http://www.saje.net"> (SAJE) </a>, a Los Angeles-based tenant rights, equitable development and housing organization. OWN-IT! features an easy-to-use, interactive mapping tool that shows all of the residential, commercial, and industrial properties in L.A. County. Users can click on individual buildings to find out when they were constructed, the number of units they contain, and the owner&rsquo;s name, contact information, and property records, among other information. Users can also track Housing Department violations, whether the building has an <a href="https://sftu.org/ellis/">Ellis Act filing</a>, and whether it&rsquo;s covered by a city or county rent-control ordinance. OWN-IT! also includes analytics developed by SAJE which display patterns of displacement vulnerability and gentrification using unique scoring that compiles parcel-level and census-tract level data. The trends shown in the tool amplify community organizing, planning, and policy advocacy strategies designed to prevent displacement.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://evictorbook.com">Evictorbook</a>: A web-based tool created by the <a href="https://antievictionmap.com/">Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP)</a>, Evictorbook provides key data about properties and landlords in San Francisco and Oakland.&sup1; This includes information on a building&rsquo;s eviction filing, building permit, and building complaint history. Evictorbook increases transparency around corporate ownership of housing by revealing the shell companies that corporate landlords often hide behind and the ownership networks to which they may belong. This transparency will help keep people in their homes by giving renters and organizers information that can support advocacy campaigns and tenant counseling. It will also help land trusts and other community organizations identify and evaluate properties for acquisition and preservation as affordable housing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&sup1; AEMP originally created Evictorbook with a focus on the City of San Francisco, prior to any involvement by SPARCC. SPARCC funding and collaboration helped expand the tool to cover Oakland and incorporate additional datasets.<strong><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be0da387-7fff-b704-2bf2-6102d296ccdc"> </strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.denverregioncad.org">Community Alert Database</a>: A tool created for community by community, the CAD is metro Denver&rsquo;s one-stop shop to research property owner information and empower communities to combat displacement and enhance quality of life for residents and business owners. CAD users can access property data and community indicators, like who owns their building and how many other properties those owners have in the region. The CAD can assist in outreach efforts to tenants to organize and mobilize around specific issues, especially bad actor landlords, and augments other data tools to identify place-based issues and opportunities, like land acquisition.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Challenges</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Creating community-centered property data tools doesn&rsquo;t come without challenges. This begins with the cost of building and maintaining a user-friendly database. In addition to data acquisition and hosting costs, it takes a lot of labor to clean, compile, and visualize this information in an accessible way. The AEMP team volunteered hundreds of additional hours to work on Evictorbook. Once these tools are launched, maintaining, updating, and expanding them will require additional labor and funding support. There&rsquo;s also a need to educate community-based organizations and residents on how these tools work and can be applied in practice, which takes additional time and energy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One other challenge in building these tools is the variation in data availability from city to city and state to state. Relevant data comes from different public agencies at different levels of government, at different times, and a lack of standardization means that it takes varied forms from place to place. For example, while cities like San Francisco keep clean and detailed data on eviction filings, many localities fail to even collect the kind of eviction information that is of interest to renters and advocates, let alone provide a publicly accessible platform. Scaling can pose similar challenges;, the San Francisco Bay Area comprises nine counties and more than 100 cities, each with their own data collection practices, datasets and formats. And with local agency staff often serving as gatekeepers to relevant property data, their level of cooperation will similarly vary. Creating tools like the three showcased here takes persistence, consistent focus on community and its needs, creativity, and, often, responsive public agencies to assemble the necessary data.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Next Steps</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Data can both help and harm communities. Historically, data gathering has been extractive of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx Americans, the results of which are then weaponized to create policies and systems that discriminate against them. As these three tools and similar efforts in <a href="https://www.displacementalert.org/">other cities</a> demonstrate, data has increasingly become an important part of the struggle over how cities are shaped and who shapes their development. Today, community activists are showing what it looks like to help renters keep pace with larger, well-resourced institutions in this new domain of information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Spring 2023, AEMP will be leading training workshops for community partners on how to use Evictorbook, including to assess property acquisitions. AEMP also plans to expand Evictorbook to additional jurisdictions beyond San Francisco and Oakland. They have already received interest from community partners in other cities and counties.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Denver, CAD&rsquo;s creators will continue training community partners on use of the tool and gather user stories and feedback to create case studies to share and iterate the platform with each update. The CAD team is partnering with a local housing authority to share the cost of data updates, as they are using similar data to identify properties to preserve for affordable housing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And in Los Angeles, SAJE is building on a <a href="https://www.saje.net/blogownit/">late summer 2023 launch of OWN-IT! 2.0</a> that will feature an interface update, local political district overlays, and new data on publicly-owned land. With new <a href="https://www.cacltnetwork.org/new-foreclosure-intervention-program-gets-500-million-first-of-its-kind-anti-displacement-initiative/">state </a>and <a href="https://www.libertyhill.org/news/reports/community-land-trust-partnership-program/">county funding</a> for the community-led preservation of at-risk housing, there&rsquo;s renewed urgency to ensure that renters, organizers, and mission-driven housing organizations have access to the kinds of information that can help inform building purchases and other mitigation strategies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With momentum in the policy realm and these proofs of concept making their way to the public, the growth and expansion of community-centered data tools will depend on continued philanthropic support, public sector cooperation, and a collective recognition of the value of data in the fight for housing stability.</p>
