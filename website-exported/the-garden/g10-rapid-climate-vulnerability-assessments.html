<h1>Assessing Climate Vulnerability in SPARCC Communities</h1>


<p dir="ltr">By Marissa Ramirez</p>
<p dir="ltr">While holding space for the hope of our thought leadership and beauty in our communities, we continue to grapple with the multi-dimensional stresses communities face. It&rsquo;s no surprise that at the start of the initiative, SPARCC priorities reflected addressing the basic needs like stable, affordable housing that stemmed from disinvestment in some places and record development in others. Increased exposure to climate change in the form of flooding, drought, and extreme temperatures make it even harder to meet these needs. As the impacts of climate change grow, actively addressing these impacts within the built and natural environment where people live is not a privilege for some, but an imperative for all. This is especially true for Black and Brown communities and SPARCC communities and a realization of the need for a collaborative basis for addressing vulnerabilities in communities and prioritizing and aligning climate adaptation as a means of addressing poverty, improving health, and creating opportunities for wealth. This was the impetus for creating the<a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RCVA_REPORT_SINGLEPG-1.pdf"> Rapid Climate Vulnerability Assessment Tool for Communities</a> (RCVA).</p>


<a href="assets/files/pasted image 0.png">pasted image 0.png</a><br>
SPARCC site participants participate in a RCVA.


<p dir="ltr">Scientifically, vulnerability is determined by the intersection of a community's exposure to climate risks, how sensitive we are to the risks given the intersections of climate and non-climate stressors, and our ability to withstand them. The value of the RCVA tool for SPARCC is in assessing the vulnerability of people and place, exploring the adverse effect of climate change, how it exacerbates and intersects with challenges of health and equity, and creates a pathway to addressing those vulnerabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The tool was developed to support communities in creating climate-savvy policies and investments that perpetuate inclusive, equitable, sustainable community development practices that contribute to health and well-being. The tool is a simple, four-step process of evaluating community vulnerability while collaboratively identifying solutions. Step one starts with identifying a community&rsquo;s existing goals and the activities to achieve the goal. Step two uses existing knowledge and data to determine how these goals and activities will be impacted by climate change - from rising seas to hotter summers, given existing conditions in communities. Step three is focused on devising solutions that address the vulnerabilities most impacting community priorities. Step four includes the development of an implementation plan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike assessments led by policymakers, the process of using the tool is community-driven, in partnership with community residents, leaders, and local governments, to collectively plan for future change and increase the impact of resources spent. The four-step process was meant to start with community goals and build on solutions grounded in history and local assets, not often represented in external assessments. This allowed us to assess the idea of &ldquo;risk&rdquo; differently by working across sectors and with real people. For SPARCC, that means considering both climate stressors like heat or storms and non-climate stressors, like the social determinants of health, connectivity and displacement. Once these links are made, step three includes developing solutions that address specific vulnerabilities. Step four focuses on prioritizing these solutions to support community members goals and a plan for implementation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Related, the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/guide-community-climate-vulnerability-assessments-report.pdf">Guide to Climate Vulnerability Assessments</a> provided a primer for communities and community partners to identify pathways for actions in an integrative process that can become part of a broader local adaptation plan. The guide also included a technical introduction to a data-driven approach, including a method for vulnerability indices and mapping.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Outcomes</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the first phase of the initiative, the tool was designed and piloted with <a href="http://ecoadapt.org/">EcoAdapt&rsquo;s</a> leadership in 5 SPARCC communities (Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Denver, and Bay Area) to quickly identify core challenges regionally and at the project level. They were implemented as multi-stakeholder, full-day workshops. Each workshop resulted in a completed RCVA worksheet with local climate data, an assessment summary of the outcomes and process, and the integration of findings into site work plans and processes. Some important key outcomes included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In Los Angeles, community development partners identified the needs of vulnerable populations suffering from heat stress, resulting in a commitment to integrate public cooling shelters into their housing development plans, in addition to considering climate vulnerability in future development</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In Chicago, data developed through the assessment was integrated into the EcoDistricts project. This included a focus on generating more localized air quality data in areas with significant asthma rates - a problem exacerbated by increasing heat.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In Atlanta, community members incorporated climate resilience into their community planning in a priority neighborhood and more intentionally partnered with public health experts to ensure that residents can have healthier housing with greater energy security and increasing greenspace and trees that can withstand hotter climate and less predictable precipitation patterns.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 dir="ltr">Learnings from community-focused RCVAs</h2>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Across each of the workshops and RCVA, we came away with several takeaways across each of the SPARCC communities</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Data: The RCVA can be valuable both as a thought exercise or with rigorous data and mapping. A full analysis is useful, however local experience is valuable and may encourage more engagement in the process. In either case, the RCVA leads to greater inclusion of climate in local planning.</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Climate champions: It&rsquo;s important to identify a local point of contact on the project team or site table to to organize the RCVA and related activities. Just as importantly, this champion is necessary to ensure implementation of outcomes. In phase 2 of SPARCC, site tables identified climate champions to lead the local climate efforts.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Conscious facilitation: Facilitators and participants recognize the unique value that each person brings to the table, including personal and professional experience with climate vulnerability in their community. Facilitators should remind participants to keep sensitive information confidential and to stay engaged for the full workshop.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Displacement is a theme: Displacement is a vulnerability that emerged across sites and both impacts displacement directly and may be impacted by climate-related investments themselves. As a result of this finding, further research was undertaken by SPARCC to further frame this vulnerability.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Heat is a consistent climate stressor: Heat vulnerability emerged as an issue in all SPARCC communities often due to racially discriminatory housing practices. Yet, in many cases, heat was not previously accounted for in work plans. In a <a href="https://www.cakex.org/documents/climate-informed-health-activities-sparcc-states-california-colorado-georgia-illinois-and-tennessee">SPARCC survey</a> of public health officials, extreme heat events were the biggest concern for more than 90% of participants. SPARCC practitioners have begun <a href="https://www.sparcchub.org/2021/06/28/extreme-heat-has-extreme-health-implications-how-cities-and-policies-need-to-adapt-to-a-warming-world/">implementing interventions to help keep residents cool</a>. Now, a more explicit focus on heat mitigation through energy efficiency, resilience hubs, and urban greening is supporting efforts to keep people cool and healthy.</p>
