<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Memphis Connection: Centering Black Joy in a City Built with Soul</strong></h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;ve ever visited Memphis you&rsquo;ve likely wound up on Beale Street. Voted second only to Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Beale Street has been called everything from America&rsquo;s most iconic street to the birthplace of the Blues. Today, you&rsquo;ll find this historic street lined with bars, eateries, and unique novelty shops. Yet, in a city that is 63 percent Black, nearly 80 percent of those businesses are owned by white people. It begs the question: how can a town rooted in the Black experience progress into the future without erasing the foundation &mdash; the soul &mdash; upon which it is built?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Named after its sister city that sits along the Nile River in Egypt, Memphis means enduring and beautiful. Memphis is more than music. It&rsquo;s more than lights, sounds, and world-class barbeque. At its heart, Memphis has always been about people, their connection to each other, and the city they love.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Memphis and the Movement</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Historically, Memphis has been at the heart of change in this country. During the Civil Rights Movement, the city was where Black people came to entertain and be entertained. To shop, strategize and protest. When city sanitation workers decided to strike in response to deplorable job conditions, they marched down Beale Street joined by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memphis would be the site of his last protest march, his last sermon, and his last breaths before he was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The night before, Dr. King gave his &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Been to the Mountaintop&rdquo; sermon at the Mason Temple. At the beginning of the speech, Dr. King states, &ldquo;Something is happening in Memphis; something is happening in our world.&rdquo; More than fifty years later, something is still happening in Memphis and our world. Many of the same battles that were being waged in the 1960s remain in the 21st century.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Memphis Blues</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Memphis faces many glaring problems. Black Millenials 4 Flint (BM4F) Founder and CEO, SPARCC partner and Memphis native LaTricea Adams recently<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/memphis-white-house-advocate-confronting-redlining-and-environmental-injustice?mc_cid=1856271492&amp;mc_eid=ae2671d973"> gave insight</a> into the challenges the city is facing, specifically the legacy of redlining and racial disparities and their lingering effects on affordable housing and climate.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">She noted that the once racially diverse and thriving communities in North Memphis including Frayser and Raleigh have recently seen significant divestment and adverse affects from extreme weather, leading to extreme poverty. Flooding in these areas have created environmental hazards including mold and contaminated dust that comes following the abatement of affected homes. Additionally, the Memphis heat index continues to rise creating an energy burden for homes that are in need of weatherization and upgraded air-conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Memphis, like many urban areas is also seeing the rise of gentrification. Neighborhoods that for decades were plagued with harmful pollution are now booming with developement. Long-time residents have been displaced and priced out of their newly redeveloped neighborhoods. Now, with the changing demographics, long-standing environment issues that had long been ignored are now being addressed to appease the more affluent, whiter residents.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The work is a living thing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Memphis, of all the cities SPARCC has been privileged to work with, encompasses both the need and opportunity that we hoped to address through this initiative. While there are many strengths and major opportunities for growth, there are also tremendous challenges in the areas of housing, climate and environmental justice, health and many other historical issues that threaten to rip the soul out of the city.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Our SPARCC partner, The Center For Transforming Communities (CTC) in Memphis, is engaging in truly revolutionary work that will provide a sustainable blueprint for the city to move forward while remaining connected to the roots and culture of the city. CTC has simplified the process of community building (&ldquo;what the people want&rdquo;), community organizing (&ldquo;getting people on the same page&rdquo;), and community development (&ldquo;doing something BIG&rdquo;) by focusing on justice and safety, health and wellness, growth and education, and the arts. Most importantly, they are amplifying community voices and letting them tell their own stories.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Change has already begun in Memphis. SPARCC has been working with our Memphis partners to ensure that the investments made have lasting positive effects that provide all residents with access to economic, social, and health resources. This starts with applying our platform for Pathways to Prosperity by:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Institutionalizing policy and practices that incorporate diverse racial, economic and cultural perspectives into community planning through the establishment of an equity assessment toolkit and regional equity council.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Addressing gaps in the greenway trail connectivity and connecting with the public transportation system.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Improving health outcomes for residents by enhancing the connectivity to healthy food, health services, access to green spaces and trails, and quality affordable housing.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Improving the climate resilience of neighborhoods and the region through targeted home weatherization, repair, and improvement efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">SPARCC 1.0</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the first phase of SPARCC in Memphis we set out to work with our partners to strategically target projects that could make the greatest impact. Some of the projects included:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Table Spread</p>
<p dir="ltr">Midtown Mosque renovated a 3,750 square foot building into a food distribution facility, a nursing clinic, and a non-profit retail greengrocer providing affordable fresh fruits and vegetables to the residents of the Klondike neighborhood. The funding was used to complete renovations for the Table Spread food pantry and greengrocer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Bearwater Park Senior Housing Project</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grant funding was used to fill a gap in a 40-lot subdivision project. The development has received myriad public and private funding resources, which have been in progress for several years over multiple phases. The funds were targeted to complete the final three lots, which Oasis of Hope has reserved for low-income, disabled seniors.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Heights Line</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Heights Line is a 1.75-mile multi-use path and linear park located in the median of National Street, a critical link in the transportation system in Memphis. The Heights Line is a neighborhood-led project to redesign National Street to be safer, more attractive, and more functional. Funds covered the costs of preconstruction documents, environmental impact study, and economic development impact study.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Tom Lee House</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rehab of a historic structure (To Lee House) into a museum and facility for community-based educational programming. Removal of blight and redevelopment of an adjacent 3.1-acre site into a Senior Independent Living Facility.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Home Improvement Program</p>
<p dir="ltr">The North Memphis Home Improvement program helios prevent displacement and reduce blight by providing vital home repairs. The full amount of these grants will be forgiven over five (5) years if the grant recipient continues to reside in the property.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">SPARCC 2.0</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second phase of SPARCC in Memphis focused on restorative economics. CTC in Memphis</p>
<p dir="ltr">CTC&rsquo;s impact projects process built out through the restorative economics organizing model that was seeded in North Memphis Voice (Memphis table pilot SPARCC site that CTC provides ongoing operational and backbone support to in order to build neighborhood level organizing infrastructure through the [Memphis tables SPARCC] core grant). 2021 encompassed a networked process with the SPARCC capital team, newly brought on staff at CTC, and local community partners to understand key factors in real estate development and capital deployment in Memphis:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">facilitate capital discussions with various partners to offer opportunities to learn about the SPARCC capital toolbox with the desire to scale these facilitated discussions to the community-at-large</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">consider long-term impacts for the goals established in the 2021 SPARCC work plan (Just CHANGE public health framework for neighborhood democracies (hubs) to catalyze restorative economics</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">understand project needs to advance for support (e.g., consultation for project planning and predevelopment, consultant support for capital campaign, etc.), to position for eligibility and qualify for capital products to sustain or expand operations</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="2">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">education and technical support &ndash; financial, legal, zoning and permits, and other areas to ensure projects are viable and able to financially take on debt responsibly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Networked process with the SPARCC capital team to understand key factors for real estate development and capital deployment in Memphis evaluated projects through the Development Ready Rubric and Checklist, capturing conversations around projects that could be potentially funded under SPARCC 2.0.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">lift up specific operations that sustain and expand growth</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">identify barriers embedded in existing business practices for capital deployment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Absent of preparation, how do you seize opportunities in front of you? Relationship building.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Power of connection is prevented by the identified barriers due to community disinvestment and the uphill battle to get projects funded are the financial manifestations of those barriers in place with existing business practices for capital deployment. Process for restorative economics build &gt; organize &gt; develop is nonlinear in reality (the process experience is nonlinear) and SPARCC 2.0 became the work of preparing the community to seize opportunities and moments like Carnes Elementary School with Shelby County Schools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shared equity models aiming to provide quality affordable housing in perpetuity and other forms of investment to address crisis in terms of addressing safe and affordable housing [chronologically Binghampton efforts came first and was catalyzed by gentrification taking place in the neighborhood [Rudd video during site visit at first home that is part of land trust] and planning efforts in North Memphis for Carnes Elementary came X amount of time later [make sure to capture genesis and Carnes not catalytic for shared equity models].</p>
<p dir="ltr">CTC does not have deep roots and partnering with people in communities that do have roots. It is a very small action and does not automatically come with infrastructure and CTC can help fill that gap [on building infrastructure piece: Connectors experiences after onboarding with CTC and getting push back in their neighborhoods with community members asking about impacts to the work that is tangible for a resident [1) more than having someone that resembles the neighborhood and why it&rsquo;s necessary to build relationships with people and 2) community perceptions of outcomes &amp; impact &gt; Connector in the neighborhood is not the outcome for a resident while sufficient for funders to measure impact of organizing that lead to real estate developments and policy changes]. Ongoing balance to lifting up good work being done in neighborhoods to sustain connections and not create narratives that make it an exception because the power in connections happens naturally in many communities that are not marginalized by long term public and private disinvestment. Develop opportunities to share learnings emphasizing the importance of ordinary, day-to-day connections people can have to create solutions. Focusing restorative economics organizing on removing the barriers placed to impede healthy connections among residents. One key strategy to strike this balance is capturing the flow of funding to build and organize neighborhood democracies and the limitations of existing capital and policy products to offer communities of color financial backing to sustain this work long term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Funder outcomes based on a set of predetermined indicators and if those indicators don&rsquo;t yield desirable progress, then the program or initiative is done versus seeding resources to cultivate the land first and do all things that are necessary to yield a healthy crop. It&rsquo;s not that these things cannot happen organically, but barriers are in place to ensure people are restricted from forming healthy connections and it is done broadly through decisions on investment, the built and natural environment, access to goods and resources, and ease in which people can get to the places they need.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Beyond the glam of Beale Street is the true heart of the city - the people. Their love for Memphis is endearingly fierce and resonates like a beautiful ballad. Systemic racism, classism, and economic greed have worked to tear apart this great community over the years, but the enduring spirit of this city could never be contained. Memphis shows us the power in connection. Working together, they have re-established their collective power by shifting the narrative of economic mobility, nurturing a strong connection to the arts and culture, and listening to and amplifying the true needs of the community. With joy and compassion, the people of Memphis continue to fight to protect what they&rsquo;ve always been &mdash; unapologetically Black.</p>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Orange Mound Tower a 10-acre industrial site located on Lamar Ave. The planned commercial real estate development will feature 100,000 square feet of commercial space and 120 residential units. The site consists of a group of buildings once used for former grain operation, including a grain elevator known by residents as the &ldquo;Tower&rdquo; and is directly adjacent to a rail loading area. Occupied by United Equipment Rental and later Equipment Support Services, the site has been vacant since 2010 and inoperable for 20+ years. James Dukes of UNAPOLOGETIC and Victoria Jones of TONE, purchased the tower and warehouse space. The plan proposed by Aaron Patrick Architects and Looney Ricks Kiss includes the redevelopment of the existing warehouse and tower that will include commercial marketspace, multifamily housing, office and live-work space, a recording and performance venue, art making spaces, galleries, and courtyard. Parking will be retrofitted to include 480 spaces with a planned garage and underground plaza. In reimagining the current blighted site as a hub for Black innovation current residents of Orange Mound, Black creatives, and entrepreneurs alike will gain access to resources, opportunities, and space that will be transformative as we reimagine the future of Memphis and developments that center the community.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Tone&rsquo;s organizational mission is to elevate Black artists as innovative thought leaders, courageous storytellers and risk-taking problem solvers through intentional exhibitions, conversations, concerts, and artist development, empower Black communities with space to take ownership of their stories and how they are told by emphasizing the perseverance, strength, and brilliance that has always existed within our people, and shift the culture of Memphis through groundbreaking art, media, and communication that centers Black experiences in our City&rsquo;s past, present, and future. Or for short, Elevate Black artists, empower Black communities and shift the culture of Memphis.</p>

<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">An unexpected victory came from what began as an interest in the Klondike/Dixon homes communities, surrounding the former Carnes Elementary School site. Well laid groundwork with the community, and strategic partners, led to what began a full scale effort to empower residents, including realizing the neighbors' passion for their community and sharing the stories of their childhoods and desire to see a beloved school become a beacon of economic growth and wealth building. The CTC team rallied to make sure their voices were heard, plans were made and a team was built to navigate the SCS proposal process to win an acquisition opportunity to build something amazing.</p>
