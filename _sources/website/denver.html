<h1 dir="ltr">Pike&rsquo;s Peak or Bust!: Mining for Gold Nuggets in the Mile High City (Working Title)</h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the great California Gold Rush of 1949, migrants, immigrants and others who would come to be known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-Niner">Fifty-Niners </a>set their sights on the Rocky Mountains of what was the western Kansas and southwestern Nebraska territories. The Fifty-Niners knew there was something special &ldquo;...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._F._Stephenson">in them thar hills</a>&rdquo; once home to the Apaches, Utes, Cheyennes, Comanches, and Arapahoes Nations, and The Pike&rsquo;s Peak Gold Rush would help to form what is now known as Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This shining city on a mile high plateau in many ways is what most American cities aspire to be. The city is considered a young, hip and desirable place to live that is well on its way to major city status. The city enjoys 300 plus days of sunshine a year which gives you ample time to get out and enjoy the largest city park system in the nation, with 14,000 acres of mountain parks and 2,500 acres of natural areas.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Denver is also home to noted colleges and universities, four major professional sports teams including the Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos and boast the second largest performing arts center in the world spending more money for the arts per capita than any other US city. To the outside it may seem as if the streets were paved with gold. Not quite, but the Colorado capitol dome is plated in 24 karat gold.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">With so many positive things happening in Denver it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to see the inequities that lie just below sea level in this mile high city. Like many American cities they face the challenges of bridging the gap between the old and the new, ensuring equitable progress and opportunity, all while addressing the lingering injustices woven into the fabric of this country.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Drivers of inequity in Denver are both historically rooted and brand new. Like many American cities, racist and discriminatory policies and practices have either blocked or made it extremely difficult for a majority of Black, Brown and Indigenous people to find jobs that pay a livable wage, safe and affordable housing, quality education and access necessary health services. SPARCC, along with partners like Mile High Connects identified a unique thread in Denver that would serve as the linchpin to begin addressing these inequalities &mdash; transportation.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">It shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that for a city like Denver transportation would be key to the great divide between the haves and the have-nots. Denver is one of the few cities in America that wasn&rsquo;t built on a road, railroad, lake or navigable body of water. Today, it&rsquo;s home to Colfax Avenue, the longest continuous street in America at just over 26 miles, but Denver has a long way to go to close the loop in many of its communities of color.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Like many cities, Denver has a history of discriminatory housing policies that redlined Black communities, segregating them into inner city neighborhoods. Over the years the rapid growth across the Metro Denver region has greatly impacted low-income communities and communities of color. Currently, less than 6 percent of Denver&rsquo;s regional housing is permanently affordable with many low-income families across the region struggling to pay their mortgage or rent every month. After paying for housing costs, there is little left for other essentials like food or childcare.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Neighborhoods like Five Points and Whittier are now far along in the process of gentrification and have lost much of their cultural identity as more affluent residents displace the original residents driving up property values and property tax burdens.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Latino communities on the Northside and throughout West Denver are also in a state of flux. The once-vibrant community has decreased by 40 percent in the past decade. The State of Colorado&rsquo;s constitutionally mandated prohibition on rental regulation of any kind has compounded these issues and sections of the region that had affordable housing have seen rents nearly double.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Disparities among racial and income groups can also be seen in health outcomes as carbon emissions from the highways have led to poor air quality and higher rates of asthma.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">While these issues are not exclusive to Denver, so much of it is tied to the city&rsquo;s poor transit model. Transportation is the second largest expense for families, but few consider these costs when choosing a place to live.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Jobs and Economy:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">266,000 projected jobs over the next 10 years will be middle skilled jobs across technology, healthcare, and construction.The typical job is accessible to only about 27% of its Denver metropolitan workforce by transit in 90 minutes or less.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Education:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Less than 10 percent of the metro area&rsquo;s preschools are located within a mile of planned or existing RTD stations and fewer than 3 percent are within half a mile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">With only 15 percent of Denver&rsquo;s top performing schools within a mile of an RTD transit station, transportation can be a barrier to low-income families choosing quality school options and for their children to participate in additional learning time, activities, and sports.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Health and Wellness:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Many basic health services are hard to access via public transportation, making it challenging for low-income families to access the preventive health care, healthy food options and other resources they need to stay healthy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Only 16.7% of low-income people living within a half-mile of a transit stop also live more than a half-mile from a grocery store. Limited public transit options, contributing to higher rates of obesity and other chronic diseases</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">These harsh realities impressed upon SPARCC and our partners to be intentional about how we would invest in the Denver community. Thankfully, the people of Denver had already begun to make this same commitment. Over the next decade, billions of dollars of public and private sector funding will fuel new investments in transit infrastructure in the Denver Region. In 2004, voters approved FasTracks, a $7.8 billion transit expansion to add 122 miles of railway, 18 miles of bus rapid transit, and more buses serving the regional transit district. As the region&rsquo;s transit system nears completion, the City of Denver has set the most aggressive climate goals in its history. Mile High Connects (MHC) and SPARCC aim to ensure that this multi-billion dollar, tax-funded public investment offers opportunity to all.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To date SPARCC has invested XXX into the metro Denver area through a number of notable projects:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">West Denver Single Family ADU -<a href="https://www.mywdrc.org/"> West Denver Renaissance Collaborative</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">$250,000</p>
<p dir="ltr">The creation of studio, one-, or two-bedroom units in backyards or over garages provide residents with the ability to earn extra income to cover rising property taxes while providing stable, long-term housing for another family. The ADU program provides a solution to address residents&rsquo; (both homeowners and renters) concerns of displacement. The program also provides an opportunity for intergenerational wealth building. The capital grant was used as a revolving fund for the development funds. The SPARCC innovation grant was used to assist with the costs to create the ADU program and was important in attracting additional capital.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">BuCu West Bottling Plant -<a href="https://www.bucuwest.com/"> BuCu West</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">$165,770, Awarded 2019</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grant dollars will bridge funding from support a down payment so that BuCu West can put the property under contract and prevent its sale to a buyer that does not share the community&rsquo;s inclusive vision for the neighborhood. The project plans include the expansion of an existing bottling business that currently employs 6 local residents and the creation of a small community center. This new location will allow the bottling business to grow by an estimated 3 or 4 times its current size. The bottling company intends to become a worker-owned cooperative. The small community center will provide space for peer-to-peer educational classes, a community art gallery, and temporary workspaces for local artists/entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">For the first settlers of Denver it was all about the gold they found there. This coupled with the idea of adventure and new opportunities brought people of all walks of life to create a metropolis among the mountains unlike any other. The city continues to innovate and grow, but for it to continue to thrive, Denver must mine its greatest resource - people. It may be fun to chase shiny gold objects, but the richness will always remain with the people of Denver&rsquo;s varied and diverse communities. The work of SPARCC and partners like Mile High Connects</p>
